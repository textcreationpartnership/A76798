            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>VI.</hi> Concerning the Pen-man <hi>Matthew,</hi> obſerve we, firſt, the time wherein he wrote, for which we can have nothing but humane teſtimony, which is, as <hi>Pareus</hi> mentions out of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philact</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that <hi>Matthew</hi> in <hi>Judea</hi> firſt wrote the Goſpel in the third year of <hi>Caligula,</hi> which was the ninth year after Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven; and it was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Fathers, that the Goſpels were written in the ſame order we have them in the Bible, the Goſpel according to <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> the ninth year after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, the Goſpel of <hi>Mark</hi> two years after, the Goſpel of <hi>Luke</hi> in the fifteenth year after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, and the Goſpel of <hi>John</hi> in the thirty ſecond year after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, as <hi>Theophilact</hi> noted. Secondly, concerning the Language wherein <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote, the learned generally declare, that he wrote it in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, for he abode about eight years in the Countrey of <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, as it hath been held by the great conſent of Antiquity; therefore it's likely the Goſpel was written in the Language of that Countrey, ſo <hi>Papias, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates out of <hi>Pantenus,</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:171178:10"/>of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſo could not be the ſon of God naturally, or elſe the Genealogy of <hi>Joſeph</hi> proves nothing concerning the generation of Chriſt, that he was of the linage of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though <hi>Joſeph</hi> were the ſuppoſed father of Chriſt, yet his genealogy proves that Jeſus was the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe <hi>Mary</hi> his mother was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>David,</hi> which appears becauſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a juſt man, and fearing God, therefore he maried a wife of the ſame Tribe, and ſhe alſo feared God, and ſo the bond of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God lay upon both their conſciences, which is mentioned <hi>Numb.</hi> 36.6, 7, 8. Let them marry to whom they think beſt, onely to the Tribe of the family of their father ſhall they marry, ſo ſhall not the inheritance of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> remove from Tribe to Tribe — and every daughter that poſſeſſeth an inheritance, ſhall be wife unto one of the family of her father, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> may every one enjoy the inheritance of his father.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Before <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> came together, <hi>Mary</hi> was with childe of Jeſus, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.18. ſhe remaining ſtill a Virgin, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. Now <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Jeſus is ſaid to be the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Abraham, Matth.</hi> 1.1. therefore Chriſt muſt needs be the ſon of <hi>David</hi> by the mother, therefore <hi>Mary</hi> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the daughter of <hi>David,</hi> which further appears <hi>Luk,</hi> 1.32. he ſhall be called the ſon of the Higheſt, and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the throne of his father <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why doth <hi>Matthew</hi> reckon up the Genealogy of <hi>Joſeph</hi> rather then <hi>Mary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was a cuſtom among the Jews, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies of the men, not of the women ſhould be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He could not ſo well have ſet down the Genealogy of <hi>Mary,</hi> if he had not alſo ſet down <hi>Joſeph</hi> her husband, who was of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> which proved her (being a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman) to be alſo of the ſame Tribe, becauſe it was not lawfull to marry otherwiſe.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:171178:10"/>
               <p n="3">3 It appears that <hi>Mary</hi> as well as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was of the ſame Tribe and linage: for though the Jewiſh women might mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to one of another Tribe, yet if in their fathers houſe there was no heir male, and ſo the females happened to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the inheritance, to keep the inheritance in the ſame Tribe, and that it might not paſs to another, the inheriting woman was bound to marry one of her own Tribe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.7.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Becauſe Chriſt was born after the eſpouſing of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> therefore Chriſt might be aſcribed to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> he had as it were power of the body of the Virgin, and therefore of the fruit of her body. Beſides the off ſpring that is born in wedlock, whenſoever or howſoever begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is aſcribed by all Civil Laws unto the husband and wife ſo married.</p>
               <p>Therefore as Chriſt is truly the ſon of <hi>Mary,</hi> though he be not naturally but ſupernaturally born of her, ſo is he alſo the ſon of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> becauſe God attributes this fruit unto him, as a reward of keeping his virginity in wedlock till ſuch times as the Virgin had brought forth her firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, the husband and wife by wedlock are made one civil perſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.6. they twain ſhall be one fleſh. Wherefore they have all things common, and in particular a common off-ſpring, ſo that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was not the adoptive, but the matrimonial father of Chriſt, and Chriſt was ſubject to him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.51.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how doth it appear that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was then maried to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſeeing the Text ſays, <hi>ſhe was onely eſpouſed, verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Eſpouſals are as it were the firſt mariage, becauſe there is a mutual affiancing (upon a preſuppoſal of no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential impediments) hence <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Mary</hi> was then called <hi>Joſephs</hi> wife.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Joſeph</hi> is bid not to fear to take her to wife, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:171178:11"/>who being informed by the Angel no doubt did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; moreover, taking doth preſuppoſe giving, for in many places and nations, Virgins have been wont to be given to their husbands by their parents or guardians. Beſides, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.24. it's ſaid, <hi>He did as the Angel commanded him and took her to be his wife.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>So all the generations from</hi> Abraham <hi>to</hi> David <hi>are fourteen generations, and from</hi> David <hi>until the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away into</hi> Babylon <hi>are fourteen generations, and from the carrying away into</hi> Babylon <hi>unto Chriſt are fourteen generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did the Evangeliſt divide all theſe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into three fourteens?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, to ſhew the threefold eſtate of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 1 under Judges, 2 under Kings, 3 under Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Prieſts after the Captivity.

               <p n="14">14 <hi>Generations</hi>] By generation he means the perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, which adds a degree. <hi>Matthew</hi> omits ſome perſons leſs conſiderable to make the number round and fit. There wants one of theſe 42, and therefore the learned put in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonias</hi> twice, the one <hi>Joacim</hi> which was confounded (as <hi>Jerom</hi> thinks) with <hi>Jechonias,</hi> the other his ſon <hi>Jechonias.</hi> Unleſs to make up the 42 generations, we number Chriſt as the laſt perſon of the third Claſſis or Diviſion.</p>

                  <hi>The birth of Jeſus Chriſt was on this wiſe]</hi> The Evangeliſt ſetteth not forth the whole Hiſtory, as <hi>Luke</hi> profeſſedly doth, onely ſhews firſt, whence the Virgin was with child, which was of the Holy Ghoſt; 2 when it was, that is to ſay, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were eſpouſed, before they came
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:171178:11"/>together, that is, when ſhe was promiſed by her parents, or affianced unto him, but yet before they came together, ſhe was not yet delivered into the hands of her husband by her parents, but abode under their keeping and tuition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Holy Ghoſt]</hi> Not that the Holy Ghoſt was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt, but that the Holy Ghoſt did cauſe that a Virgin ſhould conceive without a man: for the Holy Spirit did not lye with the Virgin after the manner of men, but that which the generation of man could do, he himſelf could do much more perfectly, without any ſuch generation.</p>

               <p>The Law was <hi>Deut</hi> 22.14. if a man took a Damſel and found her not to be a Maid, then <hi>v.</hi> 22. they were to bring her out of her fathers houſe, and the men of the City were to ſtone her with ſtones: But <hi>Joſeph</hi> being a juſt man and enclining to mercy, would not expoſe her to open infamy, or make her a publike example. <hi>Lapide</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Cretians</hi> were wont to bring adultereſſes through the midſt of the City to be beheld and mockt at by the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was minded to put her away privily]</hi> That is, by a ſecret divorce giving her a bill of divorce ſecretly. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſeeing the holy and ſpiritual life of the Virgin, might ſeem to queſtion how ſhe ſhould conceive of adultery, and perhaps to have judged the contrary, but whence or how ſhe had conceived he knew not, but becauſe he knew ſhe had not conceived by him, he would put her away.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:171178:13"/>abounds, men dream of things beautifull, clear, and ſweet. <hi>Martyr</hi> out of <hi>Galen,</hi> tells of a man that dream'd he had a thigh of ſtone, and in a few days after he fell into a palſey, and of another that dream'd he fell into a ciſtern of bloud, which ſignified aboundance of bloud, and that he ſtood in need of bloud letting. Sometimes in ſleep, men ſeem to have ſuch a burthen they cannot bear it, ſometimes to be ſo light that they do as it were flye, which is nothing elſe but the exceſs and defect of humours. To conclude, dreams of preferment do too much point out ambition in us; unclean dreams do too much point out wandring imaginations on the day time, or exceſs of gluttony at night; terrible dreams may put us in minde what we might look for if God were not more merciful; favorable and ſucceſsful dreams may put us in minde what we might expect if our ſins did not ſtand in the way. But for Divine dreams when they are, its like the underſtanding on the day time hath been well employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Divine things, and the frequenter they are, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note perhaps a better frame of ſpirit, aſpiring after Divine things. Yet as we are not to expect direction from them, God having ſpoken cleerly by his Son, ſo are we not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to ſlight them, ſeeing God hath formerly manifeſted himſelf by them, beſides God hath not loſt any of his prerogative, but that he can manifeſt himſelf by them yet.</p>
               <p>The third part, is the ground of <hi>Joſephs</hi> conſolation, which is, <hi>[For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghoſt]</hi> becauſe fear will not be caſt out by words, but by reaſons, the Angel gives a reaſon why <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould not fear, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe that which <hi>Joſeph</hi> feared was an act of adultery, was of the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore he had cauſe rather to rejoyce then to grieve, becauſe of his ſpouſe <hi>Mary</hi> the long lookt-for <hi>Meſsias</hi> was now to be born. Such a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <hi>Joſeph</hi> had at another time when he was in his fear, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10. the Angel ſaid, <hi>Fear not, for behold I bring you good
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:171178:13"/>tydings of great joy, for unto you is born in the City of</hi> David <hi>a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord. And therefore thou</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>mayeſt take her from her friends or kindred to be thy wife, and thou mayeſt with a quiet conſcience live with her.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Angel calls him the Son of <hi>David,</hi> to raiſe up <hi>Joſephs</hi> heart to conſider, that he as well as his wife was of that family, to deſcend from whom the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to all the believers of the Old Teſtament; and ſo he, the ſaid <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſhould have the honour to be the civil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this <hi>Meſsias,</hi> as the Virgin his wife had the honour to be his natural mother.

               </p>
               <p>Here is a ſecond ground to quiet <hi>Joſephs</hi> heart, taken from the quality or excellency of this ſon whom the Virgin ſhould bring forth, he ſhould be a Saviour to ſave his people.</p>

Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and ſhall bring forth a ſon, and therefore thy ſpouſe is not an adultreſs, but a moſt pure Virgin. This the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> told the Virgin <hi>Mary, Luk.</hi> 1.31. That ſhe ſhould bring forth a ſon, and call his name Jeſus, and here the Angel tells the ſame in effect to <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus]</hi> Fathers uſually gave names to their children. <hi>Jacob</hi> called his ſon <hi>Benjamin,</hi> though his mother called him <hi>Benoni, Gen.</hi> 35.18, <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi>

                  </gap>, from his ſaving. Chriſt is the name of his Office, Jeſus of his Nature and Perſon; the name in the Old Teſtament is <hi>Jehoſcua,</hi> aſcribed unto <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Captain, and to <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Prieſt in the Type, but to Chriſt in the truth, becauſe he is the alone Saviour of his People, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. He is able to ſave them that come unto God by him; for though Baptiſm is ſaid to ſave, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.21. and Preachers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. Baptiſm doth ſave by way of ſignification, Preachers, as Inſtruments by way of publication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he ſhall ſave his People from their ſins]</hi> three things are conſiderable, 1. Whom Chriſt ſaves? <hi>Reſp.</hi> All Believers, becauſe by faith alone this ſalvation is received: all his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for he is called the Saviour of the body, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From what Chriſt ſaves? <hi>Reſp.</hi> From their ſins which would bring them to Hell: as a Phyſician brings a Potion to his Patient, not to kill Death, but to kill the Diſeaſe that would bring the Patient unto Death; ſo Chriſt came not to quench the Flames of Hell, but to ſave his People from their ſins, which would bring them to Hell. Now Jeſus ſaveth us, 1. From the power of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Sin ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law, but under grace. 2. From the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10. Jeſus who delivered us from the wrath to come. 3. From the guilt of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. There's no condemnation to them that are in Jeſus. 4. From the wearineſs and burden of ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, I will give you reſt. 5. From the remainders of ſin, this will be in another World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death? I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The means whereby Chriſt ſayes, <hi>viz.</hi> his Death
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:171178:14"/>and Interceſſion. If when we were Enemies we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by the Death of his Son, much more being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled we ſhall be ſaved by his Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. 1. By his living, to make Interceſſion for us, as it is expounded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. wherefore he is able to ſave to the utmoſt them that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for them. This is one Argument of Chriſt his Godhead to ſave his People from ſin, for it's applied to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova, Pſalm</hi> 130.8. He ſhall redeem his People from all their iniquities. If there were a Phyſician in the World that could ſave a man from all Diſeaſes, multitudes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients would come to him: how ſhould Believers then come to Chriſt, who ſaves his People from all their ſins, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.1. 2. As the Woman that had the Bloudy Iſſue touching Chriſt, was healed; ſo we touching Chriſt by the hand of faith, the bleeding wounds of our ſins are ſtanched. This is true tidings of joy to all believing ſouls, that ſuch a Saviour is born, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 22. <hi>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord by the Prophet, ſaying,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt ſets down a third ground to ſtabliſh <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s heart, and together with him the hearts of all other Believers, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Prediction of a Virgins bringing forth was foretold ſeven or eight hundred years ago, in the Reign of King <hi>Ahaz, Iſai</hi> 7.14. <hi>Joſeph</hi> at firſt was ready to be ſtartled at theſe ſtrange News the Angel told him, but when he heard that all that the Angel told him was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Scriptures, this brought full ſatisfaction. The ſum of the Promiſe was, that not onely that God would ſave the Houſe of <hi>David, Iſai</hi> 7.13. from the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> their Enemies, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. but that alſo he would ſave the believers among them from their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Enemies; and becauſe the matter ſeems hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the Lord gives them a ſign to confirm it, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Virgin remaining a Virgin ſtill ſhall be with childe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt ſets forth not onely the ſum of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, but the wonderfulneſs of it. <hi>[Behold]</hi> this Adverb ſtill points out attention and admiration, <hi>[Behold]</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Men and Angels wonder at this ſtrange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of thing, that a Virgin ſhould conceive and bring forth <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> that is, God-Man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.22. The Lord hath created a new thing upon earth, A Womam ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs a man.

               <p>
                  <hi>And they ſhall call his Name</hi> Emmanuel] that is, being interpreted God with us, that is, not onely ſpiritually, that is, reconciled to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. but becauſe the Word was made Fleſh and dwelt among us, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>[They ſhall call]</hi> all the ſaithfull and many others ſhall ſo call him God with us; for this Pronoun Relative <hi>[they]</hi> hath reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a plurality.

Shut your eys
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:171178:15"/>without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſay, that you know no other God but he, that was in the boſom of <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſuckt her Breaſts. Where that God <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is, there is whole God, or the whole Divinity found, the Father and the Spirit, <hi>Luth. in Pſ.</hi> 130. I ſhall alſo add what a late Writer adds to interpret this Propheſie, <hi>viz.</hi> that within a ſpace of time wherein a Virgin might marry, and conceive, and bring forth, and the Childe come to the diſtinguiſhing of good and evil, <hi>Iſai</hi> 7.14, 15. <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah, Ahaz</hi> his two Enemies, ſhould be brought low, and from this he calls an high improved ſenſe over and above the vulgar ſenſe which belonged to the words, that from this place the Spirit ſhould gather, that a Virgin ſhould bring forth a Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 24. <hi>Then</hi> Joſeph <hi>being raiſed from ſleep did as the Angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s obedience to the Angel ſeen, firſt in taking unto him his Wife, as the Angel bad him. When we are convinced of Gods Commands, we muſt neither diſpute them nor delay them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.60. now <hi>Joſeph</hi> takes both Mother and Childe into his tuition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 25. <hi>And knew her not untill ſhe brought forth her firſt-born Son, and called his Name</hi> Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Here is the ſecond thing wherein <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s obedience to the Angel was ſeen, <hi>viz.</hi> in not knowing his Wife, he means in a matrimonial way, as it is taken <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.1. to make it appear that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not conceived of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but of the Holy Ghoſt. So the phraſe is taken <hi>Num.</hi> 31.35. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.19. No doubt the Angel had given <hi>Joſeph</hi> command herein, not to know her, becauſe he did as the Angel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: this was done, as for the ſtabliſhing of our Faith on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as being conceived in ſuch a wonderfull manner, ſo for to verifie the Promiſe, that the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>[Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhe brought forth her firſt-born Son]</hi> It is not for us to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:171178:16"/>contend to finde whether the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> were a Virgin ever after ſhe brought forth her firſt-begotten Son, it is curious to ſeek, and more curious directly to define; that ſon is ſaid to be the firſt-born, before whom there was none, though he were the onely begotten. This word <hi>[untill]</hi> oft ſignifies an infinite time or perpetuity, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110.2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.15. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 123.2. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.35. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.8. <hi>Job</hi> 27.5. <hi>Iſai</hi> 22.14.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt-born]</hi> the firſt-born excelled the reſt of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, 1. in power, and therefore when the Father died it's ſuppoſed the eldeſt Son ruled in the Family before Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of Magiſtracy were ſet up: ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> was firſt-born, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 29.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt-born had a double Inheritance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. or a double portion in the Inheritance; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> excelled, 1. in his divine nature, being begotten of the Father from everlaſting, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.2. 2. In his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, and born of a Virgin.

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>IN this Chapter there are three parts, 1. The Hiſtory of the Wiſe men and of <hi>Herod,</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 10. to <hi>v.</hi> 12. 2. The Flight of <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> with the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and her Childe <hi>Jeſus,</hi> being thereunto warned by God, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15. 3. The bloudy Cruelty of <hi>Herod,</hi> in ſlaying the Infants of <hi>Bethlehem, v.</hi> 16, 17, 18. 4. The death of <hi>Herod</hi> with the return of <hi>Joſeph, Mary,</hi> and the Childe <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Nazareth</hi> a City of <hi>Galilee, v.</hi> 19. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>In this Hiſtory of the Wiſe-men we have 1. the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the Wiſe-men, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. Where is he that is born King of the <hi>Jews, v.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ground of their Inquiry, For we have ſeen his Star in the Eaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The effects of this Inquiry, which are three, 1. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> was troubled, and all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with him, <hi>v.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> gathers all the chief Prieſts and Scribes to inquire where Chriſt ſhould be born, which he found to be in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. 3. <hi>Herod</hi>'s diſmiſſion of the Wiſe-men with a pretence to worſhip that new King as ſoon as he knew where he was, <hi>v</hi> 7, 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſatisfaction theſe Wiſe-men had to their Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, amplified 1. From the Sign, which was, the Star they ſaw in the Eaſt went before them, till it came and ſtood over the place where the young Childe was. 2. From the thing ſignified, They came into the houſe and ſaw the young Childe with <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their Gratulation or Thankfulneſs for this ſo great Mercy, ſeen in four Particulars, 1. In their great Exultation, They rejoyced with exceeding joy, <hi>v.</hi> 10. 2. In their Devotion, They worſhipped him, <hi>v.</hi> 11. 3. In their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Contribution, in that they opened their Treaſures and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:171178:17"/>preſented unto him gifts, gold, frankincenſe and myrrh, <hi>v.</hi> 11. 4. In their carefull preſervation of him whom they found, they would not return to carry word to <hi>Herod,</hi> as judging him to pretend hypocritically, but returned to their own Country another way, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>Now when</hi> Jeſus <hi>was born in</hi> Bethlem <hi>of</hi> Judea, <hi>in the days of</hi> Herod <hi>the King, behold there came wiſe men from the</hi> Eaſt <hi>to</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 1 <hi>Now when</hi> Jeſus <hi>was born in</hi> Bethlem <hi>of</hi> Judea] The inquiry of the Wiſe men is ſet down, firſt from the place where Chriſt was born, which was <hi>Bethlem Judah.</hi> There were two <hi>Bethlems,</hi> one in the Tribe of <hi>Zebulon, Joſ.</hi> 19.15. another in the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> called <hi>Bethlem Ephrata, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> 5.2. in this was Chriſt born: 1 Becauſe the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> had fore-told it; 2 Becauſe the place it ſelf might point out unto them the Judge of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the <hi>Meſsias:</hi> 3 <hi>David</hi> himſelf was born there, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.12. therefore it was fit that the flower of the houſe of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> ſhould aſcend and grow where the root was.</p>

                  <hi>In the days of</hi> Herod <hi>the King</hi>] 2 The Wiſe mens inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is ſet down from the time, <hi>viz.</hi> in the days of <hi>Herod</hi> the King, that is in the time or reign of <hi>Herod Aſcalonites:</hi> It was a time of great affliction, when even little children ſuffered, enough to make <hi>Rachel</hi> mourn as ſhe lay in her grave, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.15. As the Propheſies of him came when the Church was in great diſtreſs, as <hi>Balaams</hi> Propheſie when in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17. <hi>Eſaias</hi> Propheſie when they were ready to be over-run with two Kings, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Daniels</hi> Propheſie when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in captivity, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.14, 15, ſo himſelf came when the Church was in great diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Herod <hi>the King</hi>] Who now was old. He was a Gentile and a ſtranger, who being now King, it appeared that <hi>Shiloh</hi> was come, becauſe the Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah:</hi> Of <hi>him Joſephus</hi> ſpeaks <hi>l.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Herod</hi> was an <hi>Edomite,</hi> betwixt whom and <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſtill enmity.</p>

                  <hi>Behold came Wiſemen from the Eaſt]</hi> 3 From the place, they came from the Eaſt. About this two queſtions; 1 who they were? <hi>Reſp.</hi> Wiſemen: this was none of the leaſt of their wiſedome, that they came to Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the word in <hi>Greek</hi> hath been taken ſometimes for Magicians, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.6. but its a <hi>Perſian</hi> word, and ſignifies, as <hi>Pareus</hi> obſerves, a Wiſe man, and ſo <hi>Maldonate;</hi> ſo that as the Philoſophers were famous wiſe men among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Brachmans</hi> among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Druides</hi> among the <hi>French,</hi> ſo were the <hi>Magi</hi> or the <hi>Wiſemen</hi> mentioned here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Sundry of the ancients have thought theſe Wiſe men to be Kings, but the Scripture is ſilent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: For the number of them, whether 3. or more, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſilent, but they were three at leaſt, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks not in the dual, but plural number. 2 Whence they came,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the Eaſt]</hi> Probably from <hi>Perſia</hi> in the Eaſt, becauſe both the word <hi>Magoi</hi> is a <hi>Perſian</hi> word, and becauſe they are ſaid to come from the Eaſt. And becauſe it was the Law of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to worſhip their Kings, and not to go unto them without a gift. Others think they came out of <hi>Arabia, Eſa.</hi> 60.6. All they of <hi>Sheba</hi> ſhall come, they ſhall bring gold, and incenſe: Alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.10. The Kings of <hi>Sheba</hi> and <hi>Seba</hi> ſhall bring gifts; beſides, <hi>Arabia</hi> was nearer to <hi>Judaea,</hi> then <hi>Chaldea</hi> or <hi>Perſia,</hi> beſides, <hi>Arabia</hi> abounds with gold, frankincenſe, and myrrh. So <hi>Cor. Lapide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Came to Jeruſalem]</hi> Theſe Wiſe men came a long journey, and a dangerous, through <hi>Arabia,</hi> through the black Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> famous for robberies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.5. at the worſt ſeaſon of the year. Theſe will riſe up in judgement againſt many of us, whom coldneſs of weather, diſtance of place, intention of buſineſs hinder. Theſe Wiſe men come to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> they thought the King would be born in the Royal City, and therefore they ſeek him there. Sometimes ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſeek after Chriſt, when home-dwellers look not after
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:171178:18"/>him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.25, 26, 27. Now if you ask when they came to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Some think 12 or 13 days after they ſaw the ſtar at firſt; hence the Feaſt of <hi>Epiphany</hi> or <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> but it's like the next day after they ſaw his ſtar they came forward, though it's probable that it was near upon a year before <hi>Herod</hi> put the infants of <hi>Bethlem</hi> to death, that while being ſpent in acquainting <hi>Caeſar</hi> with the deſigne, and in the plotting and projecting of the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have ſeen his ſtar in the Eaſt, and are come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the queſtion the Wiſe men propound. 1 See the greatneſs of their faith! they ask not whether he be, but where he is, preſuppoſing he was born. They acknowledge his natures; his manhood, in that he was born; his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, in that they call the ſtar his, he the owner of it; they alſo acknowledge his Kingly office ſo freely, that it came to <hi>Herods</hi> ear: they were neither afraid of <hi>Herod,</hi> nor aſhamed of Chriſt; a politick boſome faith, becomes not them that enquire after Chriſt. The queſtion was full of danger and amazement, as caſting down <hi>Herod</hi> from his throne, and to ſet up a new King, which was no leſs then capital.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ground of their faith. For faith muſt have both a ground, and an evidence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which differences a believer and a credulous perſon who believs every thing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.15. The ground of it was, for we have ſeen his ſtar in the Eaſt. For this ſtar, it was not an ordinary ſtar, for it moved as they went, and ſhone on the day time, placed lower then the fixed ſtars perhaps like a blazing ſtar. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> thinks it was ſome inviſible power, or Angel figured in the ſhape of a ſtar. And the Lord cals them by a ſtar rather then by an Angel, as condeſcending to their weakneſs, becauſe they were much imployd about the ſtars. Now if you ask, how they came to know what this ſtar did portend? Though ſome think
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:171178:18"/>they living in the Eaſt, might know it from <hi>Balaam</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17. <hi>I ſhall ſee him but not now, I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him but not nigh; there ſhall come a ſtar out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and a ſcepter ſhall riſe out of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſhall ſmite the corners of Moab:</hi> yet I ſuppoſe they came to know this ſtar by Divine revelation onely, but whether ſoever, they came to know it.</p>
               <p>But whereas ſome from hence would conclude the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judicial Aſtrology, it's groundleſs; onely this I muſt confeſs: 1 That the ſtars have an influence here below, <hi>Judges</hi> 5.20. <hi>The ſtars in their paths or courſes fought againſt</hi> Siſera.</p>
               <p>But I ſay it's groundleſs, 1 Becauſe Aſtrologers proceed by way of obſervation, as in ſuch a year, and ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Planets, wars and rebellions to have been, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this year the ſame will happen in the like concourſe; but here no experience or obſervation went before, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a Virgin brought forth before.</p>
               <p>Some have thought ſtars to be the cauſes of things: But Chriſt was not therefore born becauſe the ſtar appeared, but therefore the ſtar appeared becauſe Chriſt was born.</p>
               <p>Others in this Age, are apt to think them ſignes of our actions, as if heaven were the book wherein God writes all future actions and events: the ſtars are for ſignes oft-times, as dayes and years, but it ſeems to me in no wiſe ſignes of thoſe things which depend upon the will of man, the future motions whereof are onely known to God.</p>
               <p>That Aſtrologers alledge experience, it nothing moves me, for all the predictions of Aſtrology are mere particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; but although they had any certainty, yet it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be always in the fear of God, then to be tormented with fear of events, <hi>Luth. in Gen. cap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>We are not to heed Aſtrologers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.2. Be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at the ſignes of heaven, for the Heathen are diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at them: If they fore-tell us proſperous things and they lye, we ſhall be wretched by hoping in vain; if they fore-tell
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:171178:19"/>to us adverſity and lye, they make us miſerable by fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vain; if they fore-tell unhappy things to us and ſpeak truth, to what purpoſe is it to fore-know thoſe things we cannot prevent? and if they ſhould truly fore-tell proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, expectation would weary us out.<note place="margin">Lapide in Jer. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> King <hi>Muleaſſes</hi> fore-told in the year 1544, that he ſhould loſe his kingdome, and his life be in danger; to ſhun it he went out of <hi>Africa,</hi> and in his departure brought upon his own neck that which he would have ſhunn'd. To conclude, theſe Aſtrologers and Star-gazers, and Monthly Prognoſticators, cannot ſave us from the things that ſhall come upon us, no more then they could <hi>Babylon, Jer.</hi> 47.13.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herod</hi> ſends the Wiſe-men upon this Meſſage, that this new born King being taken, he might ſpare the reſt of the Infants of <hi>Bethlem.</hi> He pretends to worſhip him, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to worry him, <hi>q. d.</hi> Ye Wiſe-men do well to ſeek this King, for no doubt this is he that is propheſied of, and the time and place well ſuits to the Propheſie, he is that great Prince propheſied of, and therefore bring me word where he is, that I may worſhip him. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Wickedneſs is never ſo abominable as when it is covered over with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended holineſs, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.9, 10. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15 8, 9.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>When they had heard the King they departed, and lo the Star which they ſaw in the Eaſt went before them, till it came and ſtood over where the young Childe was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the ſatisfaction the Wiſe-men had to their Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the Star which a while ceaſed to appear now appears again, and goes before them till it makes a ſtand, that is, it ceaſed to go any further, and it's likely in a ſhort time va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed after the Wiſe-men came to the place where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Jeſus</hi> was. There was no doubt a great ſtumbling block to the Wiſe-men, that not a man of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to whom the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was promiſed would ſo much as ſtir out of doors to accompany the Wiſe-men to inquire after this King, but the knowledg of the Propheſie of the place where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be born, and the appearance of the Star heals this offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>And when they had ſeen the Star, they rejoyced with exceeding great joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:171178:23"/>
               <p>Here is the firſt Branch of their Thankfulneſs, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced with exceeding great joy. Joy ſhould be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the good enjoyed. A man doth not ſo rejoyce at the yeaning of a Lamb, as when his Wife brings forth a Son. There could be no greater joy than to hear and know the <hi>Meſsias</hi> of the World to be born. We ſhould rejoyce exceedingly in Chriſt, and in the means that lead to him; they did not ſo much rejoyce in ſeeing the Star which they had often ſeen before, but that they had found Chriſt whom they ſought. As it was to them, ſo ſhould it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joy to us to finde Chriſt, <hi>Song</hi> 1.4.3.4. <hi>Zacheus</hi> received Chriſt joyfully, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>And when they were come into the houſe, they ſaw the young Childe with</hi> Mary <hi>his Mother, and fell down and worſhipped him, and when they had opened their Treaſures, they preſented unto him Gifts, Gold, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, and Myrrh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is their ſecond teſtimony of Thankfulneſs, in that they worſhip him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when they were come into the houſe]</hi> Some have thought that the Tax which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> impoſed was now ended, and that <hi>Bethlem</hi> being now empty of Strangers, <hi>Joſeph</hi> had taken ſome Citizen's houſe to ſojourn in; but being the Tax continued a long time by reaſon of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of new Strangers, therefore we may ſuppoſe the houſe to be no other than the Stable whereinto neceſſity had enforced <hi>Joſeph,</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the Inn, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.7. She brought forth her firſt-born Son, and wrapped him in ſwadling clothes, and laid him in a Manger, becauſe there was no room for them in the Inn. All this was to teach us humility: the Lord of glory laid in a Manger, in ſtead of a Palace a Stable, in ſtead of a Cradle of State a Beaſts Cratch, no Pillow it's like but a Lock of Hay, no Hangings but Duſt and Copwebs, he was in ſo low a condition, 1. That all perſons may have acceſs to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:171178:24"/>him, Shepherds as well as others. 2. To ſhew himſelf to be the <hi>Meſsias</hi> and Saviour of poor as well as rich. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſuitable to the reſt of his Life which was ſpent in a great humility. Men are apt to look for a <hi>Meſsias</hi> in State, in a Crimſon Mantle, in a Cradle of Ivory, and to have found him in the beſt houſe in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> in the beſt Chamber there; but we ſhall not finde him in any ſuch place, but in a Stable. Learn we hereby to be lowly in heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And fell down and worſhipped him]</hi> No doubt by divine inſtinct they knew the Divinity of Chriſt, hence they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipt him, not onely with civil worſhip, as one born King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but with divine worſhip, which was it's like the outward geſture of reverence, and kneeling, and falling down, for ſo the <hi>Greek</hi> words ſignifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They preſented unto him Gifts, Gold, Frankincenſe, and Myrrh]</hi> It was uſual for the <hi>Perſians</hi> and for the whole Eaſtern People to go to their Kings with Gifts, <hi>Gen</hi> 42.11. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.2. They brought the beſt things their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey afforded. <hi>Myrrh</hi> grows in <hi>Arabia,</hi> Frankincenſe among the <hi>Sabeans</hi> a part of <hi>Arabia, Arabia Faelix</hi> brings Gold, therefore the Kings of <hi>Arabia</hi> brought Gold to <hi>Solomon.</hi> The Lord hereby would provide for <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Childe, being ſpeedily to go into baniſhment. For the myſtical ſenſe, it's thought they offered to him Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe as God, acknowledging his divine Nature, Myrrh as man, acknowledging his humane Nature, (that which they believe in their hearts they proteſt by their Gifts) and that he ſhould dy for the Salvation of Man, for Myrrh was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him at his Burial, <hi>John</hi> 19.39. They offer to him Gold as acknowledging him their King and the King of all the earth. <hi>Bernard</hi> acknowledges no Myſtery herein, but thinks they offered Gold to miniſter to his want, Myrrh to ſtrengthen the Members of the Infant, Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe to take away the ſtink of the place. But one end
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:171178:24"/>may be, for the fulfilling the Propheſie, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72.10. The Kings of <hi>Sheba</hi> and <hi>Seba</hi> ſhall bring Gifts. Alſo <hi>v.</hi> 15. He ſhall live, and to him ſhall be given of the Gold of <hi>Sheba.</hi> Let us bring to this our King alſo three Gifts, Gold, that is, Faith, or a Heart by Faith purified; for Frankincenſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and fervent Prayers, that may come up like Incenſe; for Myrrh, let us bring Tears, Mortification and Broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart. In that they bring not onely Gold to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Maries</hi> wants, but Myrrh and Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe, it argues there is a Myſtery lies hid herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>And being warned of God in a Dream, that they ſhould not return to</hi> Herod, <hi>they departed to their own Countrey another way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That neither the Wiſe-men nor the Childe <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould become a Prey to <hi>Herod</hi>'s cruelty, they are warned of God to go home another way. There's a ſecret Providence watches over, not onely the Head but the Members, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.1, 10. The Lord alſo hereby ſhewed what manner of a Kingdom this King ſhould have; he ſhould have a Crown, but it ſhould be of Thorns; a Kingdom, but full of croſſes, expoſed to the ſnares and perſecutions of the mighty men of the World: but alſo comforts them, that he the Lord was able to diſappoint the moſt artificial Projects of the moſt cunning Tyrants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>And when they were departed, behold the Angel of the Lord appeareth to</hi> Joſeph <hi>in a dream, ſaying, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and take the young childe and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word, for</hi> Herod <hi>will ſeek the young childe to deſtroy him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 2d part of the Chapter, in which are theſe things;</p>
               <p n="1">1 The command the Angel gives to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which was, to take the young childe and flee into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and be thou there until I bring thee word.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The reaſons of the command, for <hi>Herod</hi> will ſeek the young childe, not to worſhip him, as he pretended to the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:171178:25"/>Wiſe men, but to deſtroy him if he tarry any longer in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> All the commands of God are for the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and are founded upon reaſon. 2 A ſecond reaſon to fulfil the propheſie, I have called my Son out of <hi>Egypt, v.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Joſephs</hi> obedience in both the branches of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:</p>
               <p n="1">1 In taking the childe and his mother and flying into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 In his tarriance there; he abode there till the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> when word came to him for his return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when they were departed]</hi> We ſee the changeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of earthly comforts; as it were yeſterday the Wiſe men came, but now they are departed. See we Gods goodneſs, when one comfort is taken away, another comes. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel appears when the Wiſe men were gone. <hi>Flee into Egypt]</hi> When we look on our afflictions, remember Chriſt was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted from the cradle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> It's the duties of Maſters of Families, to take care of their relations, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Obſ.</hi> It's a ſufficient ground to flye, when we know perſons lye in wait for our lives, but with this diſpoſition, that if taken, rather we reſolve in Gods ſtrength to loſe our lives, then to deny the truth.</p>

                  <hi>Flee into Egypt]</hi> Becauſe it was a Country near at hand, whereunto the journey would be leſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And be thou there until I bring thee word]</hi> Gods command ſhould be the rule of our motion. As the ſouldier is not to leave his ſtation without the command of his Officer, no more are we without Gods command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Herod will ſeek the young childe to deſtroy him]</hi> The Angel knew this by divine revelation: For God knowes the thoughts of mens hearts a far off, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2. And the motions of our wills: Though the Angel might ſuſpect it from the cruel and proud diſpoſition of <hi>Herod;</hi> yet onely he knew it from revelation. There is no wiſedome nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:171178:25"/>can ſtand againſt God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.30. The Angel ſaith not <hi>Herod</hi> will deſtroy, but onely ſeek to deſtroy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>When he aroſe, he took the young childe and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by night and departed into Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the obedience of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> We muſt go from Country, friends and kindred when God calls, ſo <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12.1. 2 though we know not whither. Here was a long and dangerous journey for <hi>Joſeph,</hi> an old man, to carry a woman that had lately lain in, and an infant of about forty days old above two hundred miles, through a vaſt Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſojourn among perſons utterly unknown, whoſe language probably he knew not, and that in the depth of Winter; but faith overcomes all difficulties, he believes the Angel that he would bring him word when it was fit to remove, as he ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 13. Faith in <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſwallows up carnal fears.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>And was there till the death of</hi> Herod, <hi>that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord by the Prophet, ſaying, Out of Egypt have I called my ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And was there till the death of</hi> Herod] Here's the ſecond branch of <hi>Joſephs</hi> obedience. We muſt not onely go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will have us, but tarry there as long as he will have have us. How long Chriſt was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in what place, and what miracles he did, the Scripture is ſilent herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord by the Prophet, ſaying, Out of Egypt have I called my ſon]</hi> The Scripture is fulfilled four ways: 1 When that which is plainly fore-told is fulfilled, as that a Virgin ſhall conceive a childe, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 7.14. compar'd with <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When the Scripture propheſies in general of ſuch and ſuch perſons, it may be applied to every particular, as when wicked men contemned <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Miniſtry, the Lord ſends the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, cap.</hi> 6.9. to preach, <hi>That they ſhould hear but not underſtand, ſee but not perceive.</hi> To ſuch contemners
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:171178:26"/>Chriſt at ſeveral times applies it, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.13, 14, 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.39, 40. and the Apoſtle applies it to ſuch Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.26, 27. ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. as it is written, <hi>God hath given them the ſpirit of ſlumber, eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and ears that they ſhould not hear to this day;</hi> which though ſpoken by <hi>Eſaias,</hi> and aiming at the wicked that then lived under his miniſtry, yet being ſpoken in general, falls upon all that have a ſpirit of ſlumber.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Analogically, or by way of proportion. So this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Son,</hi> which is taken out of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.1. That place cannot literally be meant of Chriſt, becauſe that <hi>Iſrael</hi> there meant, the Prophet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids with unthankfulneſs: therefore it's meant by way of ſimilitude. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> the adopted Children of God were called out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo was Chriſt the natural Son of God called out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Angel, the Members were called out in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> The Head here.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Propheſies are fulfilled, by way of Type, when the thing typified anſwers to the Type. So the Prophets phraſe of calling my Son out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being ſpoken ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, was a Type of the Son of God, who was to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Angel: neither needs this ſeem ſtrange, for <hi>Sinah</hi> and <hi>Sion, Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> which ſignifie the two Teſtaments are more unuſual Types, and further fetcht.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>Then</hi> Herod <hi>when he ſaw that he was mocked of the Wiſe-men, was exceeding wrath, and ſent forth, and ſlew all the Children that were in</hi> Bethlem, <hi>and in all the Coaſts thereof, from two years old and under, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time that he had diligently inquired of the Wiſe-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have here the Hiſtory of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Cruelty, from <hi>v.</hi> 16. to <hi>v.</hi> 19. ſet down, 1 From the outward cauſe of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:171178:26"/>it, <hi>viz.</hi> his being mocked of the Wiſe-men. 2 From the inward cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> an exceeding Wrath he conceived in his heart, partly for the Indignity he conceived the Wiſe-men had done him, and partly to hear that there was one born that ſhould be Heir of his Kingdom, and he not know who he was. 3 From the cruel Edict or Command he ſent forth, to ſlay all the Infants of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> two years old and under. 4 From the prophetical Prediction thereof, <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> propheſied, <hi>In</hi> Rama <hi>was there a voice heard, Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Weeping, and Mourning,</hi> Rachel <hi>weeping for her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> Herod <hi>when he ſaw that he was mocked of the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men]</hi> We have the outward cauſe of <hi>Herod</hi>'s cruelty, <hi>viz.</hi> his being mocked of the Wiſe-men; for they promiſed they would return unto him, but God having admoniſhed them of his Treachery returned not to him, neither did <hi>Herod</hi> preſently go to murder the Infants, for about thirty days after Chriſt was preſented in the Temple, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.22. which was about eighteen days after the Wiſe-men came, and a little while after dwelt at <hi>Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Galilee, Luke</hi> 2.39. And likewiſe, it is probable the Tyrant <hi>Herod</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to finde Chriſt, that he might kill him alone, before he would kill ſo many Infants, which thing he knew would render him odious to all. Moreover there was a common Report (that when <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> came to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt to the Lord at the time when <hi>Mary</hi> was purified) that the Childe <hi>Jeſus</hi> was openly declared by <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> to be the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and from thence <hi>Herod</hi> ſuppoſed the Wiſe-men had deceived him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Was exceeding wroth, and ſent forth, and ſlew all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in</hi> Bethlem, <hi>and in all the Coaſts thereof, from two years old and under</hi>] Becauſe the Report of the Wiſe-men, and the Witneſs of <hi>Simoon</hi> and <hi>Hanna</hi> in the Temple ſtuck much in the mindes of men, ſo that <hi>Herod</hi> could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of a Tumult vent his Malice againſt Chriſt, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:171178:27"/>his Malice to a fitter time, and, hearing of his being preſented in the Temple, began to inquire where his abode was; but, when he could not finde him in all <hi>Judea,</hi> he thought he was hid for fear, he diſſembled the matter a while, thinking hereby, that his Parents fearing nothing would bring him out of the place where he was hid, but when, after his long diſſembling, the Childe was no where to be found in <hi>Judea,</hi> the ſecond year when he ſaw his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, he endeavours to take away the Life of the Childe: but becauſe no man could certainly ſhew him who or where that Childe was, unleſs that he was of the Houſe and Linage of <hi>David,</hi> and born in the City of <hi>Bethlem:</hi> hence he came to this bloudy Reſult, that if he were in <hi>Bethlem</hi> or in any of the Coaſts thereof, <hi>Herod</hi>'s Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners ſhould kill all the Infants therein, and ſo him among the reſt. And leſt there might be any errour in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he computed the time from the Appearance of the Wiſe-men; and leſt the Computation ſhould not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer, <hi>Herod</hi> adds ſomething both above and below the Compute: Two years old and under.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From two years old and under]</hi> How <hi>Herod</hi> could gather all the Infants together is no difficulty, ſeeing no doubt he had the like pretence that he had to the Wiſe-men, ſome one or other ſpecious pretence. <hi>Macrobius</hi> writing the Jeaſts of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>

It's thought he ſlew theſe Judges as a Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:171178:27"/>to his wickedneſs of Infant-killing, that he might not give account thereof in judgment.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Herod</hi> deferr'd the killing of the Infants ſo long, 1 That he might inform himſelf of the Riſe, Perſon, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Place of Chriſt. 2 That he might obtain leave of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to do it. 3 That he might get a Catalogue of all the Infants names, which was eaſie to get among the <hi>Jews</hi> that had Books of their Genealogies, and perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters in order to the Birth of the <hi>Meſsias.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fulfilled that which was ſpoken by</hi> Jeremy] <hi>Cap.</hi> 31.15. There the Prophet, becauſe the living <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> were not moved with their going into Captivity, by a kinde of <hi>Proſopopeia</hi> he brings in dead <hi>Rachel</hi> bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their miſery; now becauſe ſomething like it fell out, it may be ſaid analogically to be fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Rachel</hi> was buried near that place where the Infants were ſlain, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.26, 28, 29. That therefore the Prophet might ſhew the tragicalneſs of that dolefull ſight, he brings in <hi>Rachel</hi> weeping, as if the Miſery both of the Captivity and of the killing the Infants were ſo great, that the living could not ſufficiently bewail it. It's uſual in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies to call up the ſpirits of dead perſons.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And would not be comforted]</hi> It's credible the Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Kings name excuſed the ſlaughter of the Infants, and comforted the weeping Mothers, that the King would recompenſe their loſs with other benefits, but they would not be comforted, becauſe they ſaw they were deprived of their moſt dear Infants.</p>

                  <hi>Becauſe they are not] In vivis,</hi> they are not alive. To be, is the ſame with to live. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.14. <hi>Before I go hence and be no more,</hi> that is, live no more, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37.36. It's ſaid of a

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſeeing the Son of Man came not to deſtroy but to ſave, why would he ſuffer ſo many Infants ſo near allied to him in Bloud and Affinity to be ſlain for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the thirtieth Chapter of <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet ſpeaks comfort of reſtoring <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Chriſt, ſo here Chriſt ſhews the way to his Kingdom was by a bloudy ſlaughter, either actually or habitually. It's like theſe Infants were all ſaved, becauſe though their wills did not conſent, yet, as ſoon as they came to knowledg in a glorified eſtate, they did actually conſent, to have not onely done that but much more for Chriſt. In the Goſpel-times Salvation is by Deſtruction, Life by Death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.39. <hi>He that loſeth his Life for me ſhall finde it eternally.</hi> Now when theſe Infants could have no will to undergo their ſufferings, by reaſon of their not underſtanding, the very ſuffering it ſelf was a material Martyrdom for Chriſt, the formality whereof was made up in the free grace of God. Beſides whereas <hi>Rachel, Jer.</hi> 31.15. weeps for her Children and would not be comforted, becauſe they were not, that is, ſhe feared the Promiſes of the <hi>Meſsias</hi> profited them nothing, ſeeing they were ſo cut off from the Land of the Living, the Lord anſwers her, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eys from tears, for thy works ſhall be rewarded:</hi> that is, the work of the patience of the Mothers, who willingly part with them for Chriſt, and the work of the ſufferings of the Infants, and therefore the Text ſays not, There is a Reward to the Will, but to the Work. Of this ſort are all ſuch Infants which have been murdered for Chriſt, and out of hatred to Chriſtian Religion. Theſe Lambs were to be ſacrificed, becauſe the Lamb of the World was to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Serm.</hi> 1. <hi>de Innocent.</hi> In that then
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:171178:29"/>Chriſt ſuffered the Tyrant <hi>Herod</hi> to rage againſt theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, it was not out of any careleſs reſpect unto them, but in reference to their Crown: and to let us ſee the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full providence of God, how it's able to diſpoint the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the greateſt Tyrants, and to let us ſee the frame of the hearts of tyrannous Princes, that will do any miſchief to get or keep a Kingdom.</p>

               <p>In the remaining part of the Chapter we have three things, 1 The Angels appearance to <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt, v.</hi> 19. ſet down from the circumſtance of time, <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>Herod</hi> was dead. 2 The Angels Meſſage to <hi>Joſeph</hi> which was, to take the young Childe and his Mother, and to go into the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> amplified from the Reaſon, For they are dead which ſought the young Childe's life, <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>

               <p>Here is the Angels command to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> backt with a Reaſon, They are dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe words agree with that <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Go, return into</hi> Egypt, <hi>for all the men are dead which ſought thy life,</hi> to ſhew ſome proportion betwixt the bringing of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and betwixt the Redemption of Mankinde from Sin and Death by Chriſt.

               <p>Here's <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s obedience.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:171178:30"/>than of petty Kings, that are fearfull upon every ſuſpition, and therefore cruel: and beſides <hi>Archelaus</hi> was more cruel than the reſt of his Brethren. <hi>Herod</hi> had nine Wives, by two of them he had no Iſſue, by the other ſeven he had nine Sons and three Daughters, <hi>Alexander, Ariſtobulus,</hi> and <hi>Antipater,</hi> which three he put to death in his life-time, <hi>Joſeph.

Alſo he had <hi>Herod, Archelaus, Antipas, Philip, &amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>Herod</hi> made two Wills, in the former he made <hi>Antipas</hi> the Heir of the Kingdom, in the later he made <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and <hi>Antipas</hi> Tetrarch of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> Tetrarch of <hi>Trachonitis,</hi> therefore <hi>Joſeph</hi> thought either that no King would ſucceed <hi>Herod,</hi> (and indeed <hi>Archelaus</hi> was King onely by courteſie, not by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s appointment) or, if any King ſhould ſucceed, it ſhould be <hi>Antipas,</hi> according to <hi>Herod</hi>'s firſt Teſtament, but it proved otherwiſe: hence <hi>Joſeph</hi> was afraid, and ſo much the more, as <hi>Chemnicus</hi> obſerves, becauſe <hi>Archelaus</hi> was a bloudy man, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in his Horſe among a Multitude of People, ſlew and wounded three thouſand perſons, againſt whom the <hi>Jews</hi> rebelled, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> nine or ten years after baniſht him for his cruelty. To free <hi>Joſeph</hi> from this fear, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel commands him to turn aſide into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and to dwell in <hi>Nazareth.</hi> The cauſes why <hi>Joſeph</hi> was afraid of <hi>Archelaus</hi> was, leſt as his Father, ſo he ſhould ſeek the Life of the Childe; Chriſt being thus placed in <hi>Nazareth</hi> came not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Judea,</hi> till he was about twelve years old, becauſe now <hi>Archelaus</hi> was baniſhed, and in <hi>Archelaus</hi> the Offspring of <hi>Herod</hi> ceaſed to reign in <hi>Judea,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Governours ruled in his ſtead, who probably had not ſo much as heard of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It will not be amiſs to underſtand this Hiſtory from the Egg, as <hi>Cor. Lapide</hi> cites it out of <hi>Joſephus, Euſebius,</hi> and <hi>Zonaras. Herod</hi> being dead in the 37 year of his Reign, his two Sons that remained, <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and <hi>Herod Antipas,</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:171178:30"/>contended about the Succeſſion of the Kingdom: <hi>Augu-Caeſar</hi> committed this Controverſie to <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to be decided, his Award was to judg the Kingdom to neither of them, but dividing it into four Tetrarchies, appointed it to be governed by four Tetrarchs: he gave to <hi>Archelaus Judea,</hi> to <hi>Antipas Galilee,</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> the third Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Trachonitis,</hi> and to <hi>Lyſanias</hi> he gave <hi>Abilene,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Luke</hi> 3.1. When therefore <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, <hi>Archelaus</hi> reigned, it was not as King, but onely as Tetrarch or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of a fourth part of the Nation: after nine years of his Tetrarchy, <hi>Archelaus</hi> was baniſhed ſeven years before <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s death. <hi>Archelaus</hi> being baniſht, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> placed three Preſidents over <hi>Judea, Coponius Ambivius,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Rufus,</hi> who governed till the death of <hi>Auguſtus.

To <hi>Pilate</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Marcellus Cumanus, Claudius Faelix, Portius Feſtius, Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Florus,</hi> under whom in the twelfth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> thirty five years after Chriſt's death, the <hi>Jews</hi> began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſhortly after were overthrown by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for in the fifth year after in the eighth day of <hi>September, Jeruſalem</hi> was taken and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Titus.</hi>

               <p>This Teſtimony in theſe ſame words is no where found in Scripture.</p>
               <p>But 1 we finde it ſpoken in ſo many words of <hi>Samſon</hi> in the Type, <hi>Judges</hi> 13.5. <hi>The Childe ſhall be a</hi> Nazarite <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God from the womb,</hi> which is fulfilled in Chriſt, who is the Antitype, 1 As <hi>Samſon</hi> was exceeding ſtrong, ſo Chriſt, in that he bindes the ſtrong man, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.22. 2 As <hi>Samſon</hi> ſlew more at his death than in his life, ſo
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:171178:31"/>CHRIST deſtroyed death by his death.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There is no Witneſs brought out of one Prophet, but there is one Witneſs brought out of all the Prophets; for all the Prophets that ſpeak of Chriſt ſet him forth to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So that as in the old Law they that gave themſelves to ſome peculiar holineſs above the common Preſcripts of the Law were called <hi>Nazarites, Numb.</hi> 6.3, 6, 8. They were to drink no Wine, and to be holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So theſe things were fulfilled in Chriſt, who did not devote himſelf to Wine and ſuch kinde of Ceremonies, but to the bloudy and ſhamefull Death of the Croſs, ſo that the ſenſe is, things were ſo ordered by God that <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> being return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhould dwell at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that from his dwelling there the name of <hi>Nazarite</hi> might ſtick unto him, whereby his moſt perfect holineſs and the Vow he took upon him, which was to dy for our ſalvation, might be ſignified.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Whereas Chriſt was called in contempt a <hi>Nazarite, John</hi> 1 46.7.42. <hi>Viciſti Galilaee, Viciſti,</hi> the Saying of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> As all Chriſtians were by the Heathen contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſo called, <hi>Tertul. cont. Marcion.</hi> The Evangeliſt would turn the name into honour, withall ſignifying that it was no impediment why he ſhould not be believed to be the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> ſeeing he was called a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> not from his Birth which was in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> but from his breeding.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Chriſt was called a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> not onely in reſpect of his Vow, but in reſpect of the Place, alluding to the deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the word <hi>Nazareth,</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Neſer,</hi> that ſignifies a Branch, becauſe <hi>Nazareth</hi> was ſituate in a place abounding with fruit-trees. So Chriſt is often called by the Prophets a tender Plant, a Rod, and a Branch, <hi>Iſai</hi> 11.1. The cauſe of this name was becauſe the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was to have <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a place of Trees and Branches, for his Countrey. Chriſt is often called a Branch, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.12. The Man whoſe Name is the Branch.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:171178:31"/>
               <p>The name of the City <hi>Nazareth</hi> is not read in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and therefore it's not certainly known how it was then writ. If it were writ by <hi>Zain,</hi> then it's derived of <hi>Nazir,</hi> that is, Separate, holy, conſecrate, of the Root <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> that ſignifies to ſeparate, conſecrate. So the religious perſons of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> that ſeparated themſelves from Wine and the World were called <hi>Nazarites;</hi> ſo Chriſt in reſpect of his holy Life and Vow of his Death might be called a <hi>Nazarite.</hi> But if <hi>Nazarene</hi> be derived of the <hi>Hebrew Neſer,</hi> by <hi>Tſadde,</hi> then it muſt be written by <hi>S. i. Naſarene,</hi> then it ſignifies a Branch; and ſo Chriſt was called a <hi>Naſarene,</hi> from the abundance of Branches and fruit-trees wherewith the Town of <hi>Nazareth</hi> did abound, ſo <hi>Chemnicius, Lapide, Pareus.</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:171178:32"/>Such a long ſilence in Chriſt may condemn our pride, who are apt to think it nothing to know, unleſs others know that we do know.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry is ſet down, 1 Generally from the Time, Doctrine, Habit, Feeding, and Office of Baptizing, from <hi>v.</hi> 1. to <hi>v.</hi> 7. 2 Specially, from his Reprehenſion to the Phariſees and Sadduces, from <hi>v.</hi> 7. to <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>

                  <hi>In the Wilderneſs]</hi> For good men were wont to fly into Wilderneſſes for fear of Perſecutors, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. His Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſet forth, 2 From the place, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Wilderneſs, whither ſome think he fled for fear of <hi>Herod:</hi> he preached alſo in all the Countrey about <hi>Jordan, Luke</hi> 3.3. No ground that hence perſons, from <hi>John</hi>'s Example, ſhould live in Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes, for ſuch a kinde of Life is contrary to the Law of Creation, which ſaid, <hi>It was not good for Man to be alone.</hi> 2 It's contrary to Communion of Saints; for the Gifts and Graces we have we are to communicate to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> being in the Wilderneſs was firſt called here to preach, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.1, 2.

This Doctrine was preached by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.17. by <hi>Paul,</hi> he teſtified Repentance towards God from whom we have gone aſtray, and faith towards Jeſus Chriſt, as the way of our return unto him, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21.

               <p>
                  <hi>Is at hand]</hi> This Kingdom is ſaid to be at hand, as a Woman with childe when her tenth Moneth is come may truly ſay her Travel is at hand, ſo might the Baptiſt ſay when the laſt Weeks of <hi>Meſsiah</hi>'s Weeks was begun, the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand.

The meaning is, the <hi>Jews</hi> counted their years by ſevens, every ſeventh year being a year of reſt for the Land, and ſo called a Sabbatical year, according to which Account the Angel tells <hi>Daniel,</hi> that ſeventy of thoſe Weeks of years were allotted for the ſtanding of their Temple and Common wealth, when both ſhould be reſtored again after the Captivity, which make in all four hundred and ninety years. Now theſe four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety years being expired, as appeared by the coming of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being deſtroyed within forty years after, <hi>John</hi> might very well ſay the time was at hand.</p>

               <p>The Baptiſt gives a Reaſon why he preaches Repentance, and that in the Wilderneſs, becauſe he is that voice of one crying in the Wilderneſs propheſied of by <hi>Eſaias cap.</hi> 40. and commanding that a way ſhould be prepared for the <hi>Meſsias</hi> now come in the fleſh by repentance.

               <p>
                  <hi>The way of the Lord]</hi> That is, 1 Do not cauſe any block by abſenting from the preſent proffers of grace

Let thine eys look right on, and let thine ey-lids look ſtraight before thee, as a man that winks with one eye taking level at a Mark, that ſeems not ſo much to ſee with his eys as with his ey-lids, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.13. Make ſtraight paths unto your feet, (avoiding all crooked walkings becauſe of the croſs) leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way.

It's like <hi>John</hi>'s Garment was of the courſeſt ſort, to teach all men, in particular Teachers, all due moderation of Apparel, and contempt of the World, not to teach us to ſeek Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereby, as fooliſh Monks do by putting themſelves to penance, by wearing courſe and hairy Garments. For <hi>John</hi>'s Preaching was to carry perſons for to ſeek for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs onely in Chriſt, and not to ſeek for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by outward Apparel.

                  <hi>John</hi> had preached the Doctrine of Repentance, that whereas they thought they were righteous by their works, and without ſin, and that though they lived wickedly yet they ſhould not fear Gods wrath, becauſe God was merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, therefore <hi>John</hi> ſhowes they were all under wrath, and whereas they were confident on their prerogative, that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>John</hi> preacht unto them they ſhould change their opinion, and that righteouſneſs was onely through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Having preach'd repentance unto many of his hearers, they came to receive the baptiſm of repentance.</p>

With this confeſſion there went an holy hatred of their ſins: as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſhewed their wicked deeds, ſo they burnt their conjuring books, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.17, 18. and if the confeſſion of the ſins of perſons in theſe times baptized were more particular and with more grief, it would come nearer the Apoſtolical practiſe. Truly it argues a great change of heart when perſons formerly proud, unclean, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate and unrighteous, ſhall not onely confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſinners, but alſo ſuch kinde of ſinners. Moreover, they profeſt they fear'd the anger of God, and deſired to eſcape it at the day of judgement. Alſo they confeſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believables, that they believed on the <hi>Meſsias</hi> that was to come after, and begin his preaching, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.4. Alſo, no doubt they made profeſſions of their ſelf-denial, without which they could not be Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. nor yet <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples; for <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm and Chriſts being one and the ſame ſpecifical baptiſm, as confeſſion went before <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm, ſo muſt it go before Chriſts baptiſm, and as making diſciples (which was to teach to converſion, believing and ſelf-denial) went before Chriſts baptiſm, ſo muſt it go before <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm. And ſo the Eunuch, before <hi>Philip</hi> would baptize him, made profeſſion of his faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22, 23. <hi>Our bodies wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in pure water, let us hold faſt the profeſsion of our faith without wavering.</hi> That is, that profeſſion we made at our baptiſm.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:171178:38"/>of our ſins, according to 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. And therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that no wicked perſons that never came to the ſight of their ſins, nor to humiliation for them, are to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to baptiſm; nor yet infants, for their receiving deſtroys the qualifications preceding baptiſm, which is confeſſion, for they were not firſt baptized and then confeſt, but firſt they confeſſed and then they were baptized.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>But when he ſaw many of the Phariſees and of the Sadduces come to his Baptiſm, he ſaid unto them, O Generation of Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have here <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry ſet down, from the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion he gives to the Phariſees and Sadduces, from <hi>v.</hi> 7. to <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Here may be a Queſtion, why <hi>John</hi> threatened theſe Phariſees ſo ſeverely that came to his Baptiſm. To know this conſider, 1 Who the Phariſees and Sadduces were. 1 The Phariſees did not onely obſerve the Levitical Rites in a more exquiſite way than others, but had many other outward traditions, as Waſhings, and <hi>Corban, &amp;c.</hi> wherein they placed Righteouſneſs and the Deſert of eternal Life; to get an opinion of Holineſs, they ſeparated themſelves in Apparel and Diet from other men, but not hence were they called Phariſees, but becauſe they, not content with the Letter onely, would ſearch out the hidden ſenſe: hence were they called <hi>Pheruſsim,</hi> that is, Interpreters. Theſe Phariſees ſprung up about one hundred and fifty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt; they attributed ſome things to Deſtiny, but not all things, but they ſaid ſome things were in a mans own power to do or not to do, <hi>Joſeph. l.</hi> 13. <hi>Ant. c.</hi> 9. Theſe confeſt the Reſurrection, acknowledged Angels and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8. and to gain opinion they made broad their Philacteries, the pieces of Parchment which they wore on their Breaſts, wherein the Commandments were written, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.5. Theſe had the Office and Authority of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:171178:38"/>Teaching confirmed by the teſtimony of Chriſt, the Scribes and Phariſees ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair, whatſoever they bid you obſerve that obſerve and do. The Scribes are put before them, as being of a more ancient Inſtitution, perhaps divine.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Sadduces: Theſe denied a Providence of God in the World governing humane things, they denied the Immortality of the Soul and the Reſurrection of the Body, they thought there was neither Angel nor Devil, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8. They were indeed plain Atheiſts, who thought Religion was invented to keep men in aw: for outward and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ends they obſerved ſome outward legal Rites: theſe attributed nothing to Deſtiny, but all to the will of man, and that we are Authours as well of our own Happineſs, as of our Misfortune, <hi>Joſeph. lib.</hi> 13. <hi>Antiq. cap.</hi> 9. The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees following the faith of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets oppoſed theſe; the People followed the Phariſees, the great men followed the Sadduces. The Sadduces denied all the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> ſave the five Books of <hi>Moſes, Tertul de Praeſcrip.</hi> And therefore Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.31, 32. proves the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of them. They are called Sadduces, that is, righteous, becauſe they did arrogate the name of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to themſelves, or rather of <hi>Sadoc</hi> their Authour, as <hi>Chemnicius</hi> and <hi>Lapid</hi> affirm.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To anſwer the Queſtion why <hi>John</hi> ſo ſeverely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe Phariſees and Sadduces, the Reaſons were, 1 Becauſe of the dangerouſneſs of their Errours: the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees out of perſwaſion of their own Righteouſneſs did not fear the wrath to come; the Sadduces out of their Atheiſm did not fear or believe any wrath to come, yet both made a ſhew of Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They came to him diſſemblingly, with a minde to tempt him, not to learn by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To gain a further opinion of Holineſs by being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized of holy <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:171178:39"/>
               <p n="4">4 Hereby to ſtop <hi>John</hi>'s mouth that he might not thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt their Vices.</p>
               <p n="5">5 To diſcover them to all the Multitude who were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for their pretences to think otherwiſe of them, and in danger to be deluded by them.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That in the Phariſees and Sadduces, who were moſt blame-worthy, the Multitude might not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a feigned ſhew of Repentance.</p>
               <p n="7">7 To manifeſt his own ſincerity in Preaching, that though they were the moſt eminent men for place and learning, yet he would not ſpare them in his Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Generation of Vipers] John</hi>'s ſpeech to them is partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſory. <hi>John</hi> alludes to the Devil that old Serpent, whoſe offspring they were, as alſo to the Viper, whoſe Skin is beautifull, but her Poyſon is in her Tongue. As if he ſhould ſay, Ye are an evil Egg of an evil Bird; ye are poyſonous ſons of poyſonous fathers. Chriſt applies theſe words to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.31. <hi>Ye are the ſons of them who killed the Prophets, fill ye up the meaſure of your fathers ſins. Ye Serpents, ye Generation of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> As the Viper eats through the Bowels of the Dam, that it may come to life, <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 62. <hi>Rhodogin. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 37. ſo you Scribes and Phariſees kill your Mother, the Synagogue, and your ſpiritual Fathers, the Prophets and faithful Teachers, that you may live in your pride and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs. This Compariſon was made by <hi>Hierom</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but experience hath found the contrary true, as <hi>Geſner, Mathiolus,</hi> and others; therefore it's called <hi>Vipera, quaſi vivipara,</hi> becauſe that Serpent doth not lay Eggs, but brings forth a living Creature.</p>
               <p>Again, as Vipers devour Scorpions, and therefore their Poyſon becomes ſtronger, <hi>Ariſtot. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Hiſt. Animal. c.</hi> 29. So the Phariſees and Sadduces eating the poyſonous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Rabbins, by adding their own, increaſe the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Errours.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:171178:39"/>
               <p>Again, Chriſt ſo calls them to upbraid the whole Order of them, as well abſent as preſent; as if he ſhould ſay, Both theſe Factions beget Serpents, though they differ among themſelves.</p>
               <p>Again, as the Viper is a moſt poyſonous Creature, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4.<note place="margin">Geſner. l. de Serp.</note> When the <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſaw the Viper ſtick on <hi>Paul</hi>'s hand, they lookt upon him as a dead man, their Biting is counted mortal in the third day at furtheſt; ſuch were the erroneous Doctrines taught by Phariſees and Sadduces, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their bitter ſlanders againſt <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover this phraſe is taken out of <hi>Iſai</hi> 59.5. <hi>They hatch Cockatrioe Eggs, and weave the Spiders Web; he that eateth of their Eggs dieth, and that which is cruſhed breaketh out into a Viper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides <hi>John</hi> hereby would not onely inform them of their poyſonous malice and hypocriſie, but would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of their natural pollution they bring into the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come]</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Ye live ſo ſecurely as if there were no ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance after this Life, you Sadduces think there is no Hell, and you Phariſees are ſo preſumptuous that you think you need not fear Hell, but who hath told you ſo? It is your own carnal confidence. 2 You were never brought to the ſight of your ſin, and the puniſhment due for it, why then will you come to my Baptiſm which is a ſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins. 3 Some take it as a word of Admiration, as if <hi>John</hi> ſhould ſay, I cannot be brought to think that you do repent, though you profeſs it, but if it be poſſible for you to eſcape it, it muſt be by Faith and Repentance: certainly that your Conſciences may be awakened, know there's much difficulty herein. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.31. <hi>Serpents, Generation of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From the wrath to come]</hi> He means not deſtruction by the

                  <hi>Romans,</hi> but principally hell fire; the other is not excluded, wrath hath lain upon them ſixteen hundred years, of which Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.28, 29, 30, 31. <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.11. The Ephah, or the full meaſure of the ſins of the Synagogue, were caried into the Land of <hi>Shinar;</hi> that is, they were ſcattered all abroad, as the inhabitants of the earth were at the confuſion of tongues in the Land of <hi>Shinar;</hi> and the ephah was ſtabliſhed upon her own baſe, to ſignifie, that by their new blaſphemies againſt Chriſt and hardneſs of heart, that all the world may look upon their baniſhment and miſery, as they do upon a pillar ſet upon a baſe or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, without hope of deliverance till their converſion be accompliſhed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25.</p>

                  <hi>John</hi> layes down next after his reprehenſion, an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Phariſees and Sadduces, to bring forth fruits, that is to ſay, Works worthy of Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.20. He means not a worthineſs of merit, as if our Works could deſerve any thing at Gods hand, nor as if our Works of congruity or the moral Works of natural men could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo much of God, that he ſhould be bound to enable us to do Works of Repentance, or condignity to deſerve any thing from God: but he means a worth of ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a bountifull Lady is worthy of a liberal Lord or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:171178:40"/>Gentleman, that is, ſhe is ſutable. So, bring forth Fruits worthy of Repentance; that is, ſutable or declarative of your Repentance, as if he ſhould ſay, Shew that you do not come with a counterfeit Repentance, but let your outward ſigns of Repentance, (as care of pleaſing God, hatred of former ſins, good Works contrary to your former evil Works, tears and ſighs) evidence the inward Repentance of your hearts, and this is the way and means of eſcaping the wrath to come, wherewith I have threatned you. You O Sadduces, repent of your Atheiſm; you O Phariſees, turn the pride of your own Righteouſneſs into ſelf-abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your ſeeming ſanctity into real ſincerity, your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and griping to Alms and Reſtitution, your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureneſs to godly fear; let there be ſome ſutableneſs (though we do not enjoyn a Popiſh commenſurate equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) betwixt your Sorrow and Humiliation and your former ſins: as <hi>Peter</hi> for Denial wept bitterly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.75. Not to give ſatisfaction to God, which onely Chriſt his Bloud doth, but to ſhew your turning away from ſin, and your grief for what is already done; and to ſhew you earneſtly wiſh it were undone, and that you would not upon any terms do it, were it to do again. Beſides, Fruits worthy of Repentance implies a vehemency of affection for God, as formerly we have had for ſin, a burning affection to God, as formerly we have had to ſin, <hi>to yield our members weapons of righteouſneſs, as formerly they have been weapons for ſin, Rom.</hi> 6.13, 19. Finally know, Repentance is an inward Grace ſeated in the Heart, but the Fruits of it are brought forth in the courſe of our Life.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:171178:41"/>their repentance: As, whereas thou calls us a generation of Vipers, we are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; whereas thou exhorts us to repent, we are a holy nation: whereas thou threatens us with the wrath to come, if any ſuch thing be, it belongs to Reprobates: But we are the elect people of God, if God ſhould caſt off us that are the ſons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe would take no effect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. but he would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful. To this <hi>John</hi> anſwers, <hi>The Children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed, and not the children of the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 9.8. Birth priviledges may inright you to the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> but it cannot inright you to the promiſe of ſpiritual bleſſings here, nor glory hereafter. You do not imitate the Faith and works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the wickedneſs and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of your anceſtors ſince <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore you are not the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor an holy Nation, but a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Vipers, and in vain do you (as many in theſe days do) imagine the promiſes to belong to the carnal ſeed. This ſtill was the <hi>Jews</hi> fooliſh boaſting, that they were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams ſeed, Joh.</hi> 8.33. and thence thought themſelves free, and needed no other freedome, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the ſame time tells them they were the Bond-ſlaves of ſin, till ſuch times as he freed them, and tells them <hi>v.</hi> 39. that, <hi>if they were</hi> Abrahams <hi>children, they would do the works of</hi> Abraham. The words are, as if <hi>John</hi> ſhould ſay, Though you <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> go to Hell, the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> will not in the leaſt jot be made void, being it is not made to them that ſucceed in the fleſh, but to them that ſucceed in the faith and works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentils.</hi>

               <p>[<hi>God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up Children unto</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham] by Stones is meant either the Rocks that lay upon the Banks, or ſhore of <hi>Jordan, Luke</hi> 19.40. <hi>If theſe ſhould hold their peace the ſtones would immediately cry out.</hi> Neither was this other then when God made man of the duſt of the earth, and breathed into him a living ſoul.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:171178:41"/>Faith and Godlineſs as from the Stones; neither is it incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible for God to make Children of Stones, ſeeing <hi>Iſaac</hi> was begotten from <hi>Abraham</hi> when his body was dead (to her being an old woman, though afterwards he had Children by <hi>Keturah</hi> a young woman) and <hi>Sarahs</hi> body alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19. For <hi>Abrahams</hi> dead body is reſembled to a Stone, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.1. <hi>Look unto the Rock whence ye are hewen. q. d.</hi> You <hi>Phariſees, Sadduces,</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> think if you ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, what would God do for an off-ſpring? I tell you he is able to raiſe them from the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> nay, if need were, from the dead, or liveleſs Rocks, whence your ſelf at firſt had your beginning, and wherewith at preſent your hearts have ſome reſemblance and ſimilitude: as God turned <hi>Lots</hi> Wife into a Pillar, which was ſtanding many hundred years, yea, even in <hi>Joſephus</hi> his time, ſo can the ſame God turn a Stone into a Man, doing that bodily which he doth ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, taking away an heart of Stone, and giving an heart of fleſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.</p>

                  <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry is ſet down from the difference betwixt him and Chriſt, 1 Whereas the People might be apt to think him to be the promiſed <hi>Meſsias,</hi> he tells them he was not, he declares himſelf to be onely the Miniſter of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm, but Chriſt who was ſhortly to be ſhewn to them was the Authour of inward Baptiſm.

And therefore <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, as alſo the Baptiſm of every Diſpenſer, is not the Baptiſm of future Repentance, but of preſent Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39, 40. <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Chriſt, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſins.</hi> Hence Infants, for want of preſent Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are excluded from Baptiſm: what change of heart, ſhame, ſorrow, or hatred of ſin can there be in them?

Yet
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:171178:43"/>may we underſtand it of the power of the Spirit, or of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm, whereby the Spirit in the Hearts of Believers burns up their Luſts, not onely enlightening of them, but inlivening and kindling in them holy affections. As the Spirit is called Water from the purging away of our filth, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. ſo is it called Fire, becauſe by a ſpirit of burning he burns up our droſs, <hi>Iſai</hi> 4.4. <hi>The Lord ſhall purge away the Bloud of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>from the midſt thereof by the ſpirit of burning.</hi> In a word, Goſpel Preachers may baptize you with Water, but the Spirit renews us inwardly by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Now that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> baptize with Fire, they add to the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and to the Scriptures, which ſhadows out unto us, and preſents to our memories the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Spirit by variety of expreſſions. The <hi>Abiſsines</hi> brand the baptized perſons with Fire, <hi>Beza in loc.</hi> This practice gave occaſion to ſome bolder Library keepers in ſome Copies to blot out the word Fire. The Spirit is well reſembled by Fire, becauſe it hath the properties of Fire, as to purge, to drive away darkneſs, to ſhine, to kindle, to ſnatch upwards, to ſtrengthen, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. to change into it ſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Believers are by the Spirit changed into the ſame glorious image. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.8. It's ſaid, he ſhall ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize you with the Holy Ghoſt. Fire is left out here, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation ſake, it is added, by the Figure <hi>Hendiadys.</hi> The ſum is, Chriſt alone beſtows whatſoever outward Baptiſm figures or ſignifies. Now Fire in this place ſeems to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Water. I baptize you with Water, ſaith <hi>John.</hi> Chriſt baptizes with Fire, to ſignifie unto us that ſome fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſpiritual power towards our purging and cleanſing is repreſented to us, by the Water of Baptiſm.

               <p n="4">4 Becauſe Chriſt took our ſins upon him, and therefore, as a guilty perſon and a penitent, he offers himſelf to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, that being baptized by him he might as it were waſh away our ſins in himſelf, he did as it were bury the old <hi>Adam</hi> under Water in his Burying, and riſing up from under the Water he did as it were lift up the World of Believers that were drowned.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That, for as much as baptized ones were the Subjects of his Kingdom, that he might be like his Brethren in all things, hence he took up Baptiſm to be imbodied with his People, that he and they might be one Body.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Then]</hi> When the Baptiſt had been a while preaching and baptizing and preparing the People for Chriſt, and had told them that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was ſpeedily to be manifeſted to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:171178:45"/>them, and the people were on fire to have him manifeſted, and as the people were in expectation, and all men muſed in their hearts whether <hi>John</hi> were the Chriſt, then comes Jeſus to <hi>Jordan,</hi> where not onely ſigns from Heaven ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted him to be the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> but <hi>John</hi> alſo openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, partly becauſe the people were apt to think <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> to clear himſelf thereof, and partly to make the <hi>Meſsias</hi> known, being it was fully revealed to him, <hi>John</hi> 1.33. The people being therefore inſtant that he would ſhew the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> whom he preacht to come after him, <hi>John</hi> anſwers, that he had not ſeen him by face, but onely had received this anſwer from God, That he ſhould in his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm be manifeſted to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in this manner, that the Holy Ghoſt in the bodily ſhape of a Dove ſhould deſcend upon him.

               <p>[<hi>From</hi> Galilee] The 2 thing is the circumſtance of place. <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes from <hi>Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> leaſt any ſhould think the buſineſs was carried politickly betwixt <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> therefore providence orders it that till the <hi>30th.</hi> year of their age they live and are brought up in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe places, that <hi>John</hi> could ſay, I <hi>knew him not,</hi> Joh. 1.32. and when <hi>John</hi> began his miniſtry about <hi>Jordan,</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus did not adjoyn himſelf to him, but abode in <hi>Galilee,</hi> that <hi>John</hi> might know and preach this that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> was come into the world, but was not yet made manifeſt, and that he knew him not by face, but that he ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in his Baptiſm.

               <p>
                  <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now]</hi> We have here Chriſts Reply, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging <hi>Johns</hi> arguments to be true in reſpect of his perſon; but in reſpect of his office, it being a ſtate of emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying, and abaſement, and humiliation, therefore I will have it done (ſaith Chriſt) Suffer it to be ſo now, ſo that in oppoſition to <hi>Johns</hi> arguments Chriſt brings two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1 I am not yet declared to be the Chriſt by the deſcent of the ſpirit of God upon me, and by the opening of the Heavens, and by a voice from Heaven, but come unto thee as a private man, and therefore thou oughteſt not to refuſe me, though I am greater then thee; and therefore ſuffer it to be ſo now.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>For thus it becometh us to fulfil all Righteouſneſs</hi>] this is the ſecond reaſon. The meaning is, 1 I am not baptized for that cauſe that others are, for to ſignifie forgiveneſs of ſin, for I have no ſin, but to ſanctifie Baptiſm, that it may be a mean or an inſtrument of the application of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith. So <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Though I be greater then thee, It's the Fathers will I ſhould receive baptiſm from thee, and conſecrate it in my body, that they that are baptized into me, may acknowledg me to be one of their brethren.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This word righteouſneſs muſt not be taken ſtrictly,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:171178:47"/>but broadly, not onely to ſignifie what belongs to the law, but for whatſoever hath reſpect either to equity or hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſet down nothing of this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the Heavenly command <hi>John</hi> had received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed onely to Repenting ſinners, yet Chriſt being a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of perfect innocency, the ſign Baptiſm was not in vain in him, which ſignified a purpoſe of innocency; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could it be ſhewn more effectually how great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was due to the Rites appointed by God, than if Chriſt ſhould by his Example commend the uſe of them to us. Again, Chriſt by this Ceremony was as it were imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died with us, and to confirm to Believers that are baptized as they ought, that they ſhall have the Heaven open unto them, and the Spirit coming upon them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Chriſt underſtands not a juſtice of equality and of the Law, but of equity and of his calling. Therefore Chriſt anſwers to the Argument of the Baptiſt by a Diſtinction, which was this, The more unworthy ought to be baptized of the more worthy: Chriſt anſwers, Yea, unleſs the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of calling require the contrary, that the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy be called to baptize the more worthy? but thou art called to baptize me, for I am not here now as a Lord but as the Servant of the Lord, to be entered into the Church of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and to my duty, therefore I will do what belongs to me, and do thou what belongs to thee, and ſo both of us will fulfill the righteouſneſs of our reſpective calling, I taking up Baptiſm, and thou diſpenſing of it; thou baptizing me with the Baptiſm of Water, I baptizing thee with the Baptiſm of my Bloud.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It is a point of Righteouſneſs, that Maſters and Teachers ſhould practiſe that they commend to others, that by their own Example they may teach others, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.1. Jeſus began firſt to do and then to teach.</p>
               <p n="6">6 By Righteouſneſs he means whatſoever the Father hath commanded, whatſoever is juſt, holy, and acceptable to God.</p>

                  <hi>Then he ſuffered him]</hi> We have here <hi>John</hi>'s modeſty, that denying his own opinion he obeys Chriſt and receives him to Baptiſm. It behoves our Reaſons to fall down when ſtronger Reaſons are brought, and not to defend them becauſe they were ours. Though <hi>John</hi> thought it abſurd and uncomely, yet, when he heard the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of both their Callings were fulfill'd thereby, he gives way. So did <hi>Peter, John</hi> 13.8. that would not let Chriſt waſh his Feet, till Chriſt told him, <hi>If I waſh thee not thou haſt no part in me;</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffered Chriſt to waſh his Feet: ſo <hi>John</hi> here it's like kept Chriſt by his hands from entering into <hi>Jordan,</hi> not out of ſtubborneſs, but out of miſguided reverence; now Chriſt bidding <hi>John</hi> to ſuffer it to be ſo now, and giving him Reaſons, thereupon he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>And</hi> Jeſus, <hi>when he was baptized, went up ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of the Water, and lo the Heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove and lighting upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have here Chriſt his receiving of Baptiſm ſet down, 1 From the Adjunct, when he was baptized, he went up ſtraightway out of the Water. Becauſe he was let go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the confeſſion of ſins, when others were not, as ſome think, but rather becauſe all made their profeſſion before they came in, and ſo ſtraightway went out, therefore little can be gathered from hence, ſave that when he came out of the Water he went to Prayer, to teach us to partake of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Supper with reverence, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Now for Chriſt's Baptiſm, it was a burying of the whole Body in Water, for it was with his Members, thus <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. He is not ſaid to go out, but to aſcend, becauſe the Earth or Land is higher than the Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And lo the Heavens were opened]</hi> We have the ſigns ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying Chriſt his Baptiſm, and confirming the ſame,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:171178:48"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the Heavens opening. The Heavens were opened to him, not that the Heavens were opened upon all the Earth, but that part of Heaven where Chriſt prayed on the Bank of <hi>Jordan:</hi> or upon the reſt, as <hi>John</hi> and other ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized perſons, but upon him. The manner of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens opening <hi>Mark</hi> ſets down by cleaving, the Heavens were cloven, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to rend and cleave, as he that cleaves Wood. This opening of the Heaven was a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of this heavenly Teacher and of his Doctrine, that both he and his Doctrine were from Heaven, which by the Diſpenſation thereof opens the Gate of Heaven to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Doubtleſs there was glorious Light that by the Beams thereof ſhone upon Chriſt, like that which ſhone upon <hi>Paul</hi> going to <hi>Damaſcus, Acts</hi> 9. By this Myſtery the Lord ſignified, that Baptiſm was now conſecrated in the Body of Chriſt to be a ſign of heavenly grace. It's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like that all the heavenly Orbs were open, that men might have lookt into the Empyraean Heaven, or the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Bleſſed, which alſo fell out when <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned, who <hi>ſaw the Heavens open, and the glory of God, and</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſtanding at the right hand of God, Acts</hi> 7.55, 56.</p>

                  <hi>And the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighting upon him]</hi> We have here the ſecond ſign confirming the calling of Chriſt, and inſtalling him in his Office viſibly. This was for the fulfilling of the Propheſie, <hi>Iſai</hi> 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me:</hi> Not as if Chriſt were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit before, but now it was made viſibly manifeſt to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Like a Dove] Queſt.</hi> Whether was it a real Dove, or onely a ſimilitude?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was a bodily ſhape like a Dove, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.22. It's like it was not a true Dove, but onely the form of a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:171178:48"/>Dove, formed by the Angel, and therefore <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> ſay, As a Dove, and like a Dove. It's like it was of a fiery matter, as the fiery Tongues were. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit appears in the likeneſs of a Dove, to ſhew that that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that was in Chriſt was full of meekneſs, <hi>Iſai</hi> 42.1, 2, 3. <hi>I have put my Spirit upon him,</hi> the bruiſed Reed ſhall he not break, nor ſmoaking Flax ſhall he not quench. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. Again, a Dove repreſents the Graces of the Spirit, <hi>Iſai</hi> 11.2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him,</hi> to ſhew the innocency, purity and charity in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A Dove was the ſign of the Reparation of the World after the Floud, and here it is a ſign of Reconciliation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This Dove was a fit Reſemblance to this Lamb of God; for as the Lamb is moſt harmleſs among Beaſts, ſo is the Dove among Birds.</p>
               <p>The Flight of this Dove denotes the divine Influence of the Spirit coming from Heaven into the Members of Chriſt, as well as into the Head. <hi>Mahomet</hi> by putting Corn into his Ear accuſtomed a Dove to fly to his Ear, which eat what was there put; by this way he perſwaded the People the Spirit of God was familiar with him, and ſuggeſted to him his <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet muſt we not think this ſubſtance or body reſembled by a Dove to be hypoſtatically united to the Spirit of God, as the humane nature of Chriſt was to Chriſt, but as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels oftentimes took humane bodies and appeared to men with them, and laid aſide thoſe bodies afterwards, ſo did the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>As the Heavens were opened unto Chriſt, to ſhew his Doctrine was not earthly, but heavenly, ſo did the Spirit come upon him, to ſhew his Doctrine was the Miniſtry of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. called <hi>The glorious Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> this viſible Appearance of the Spirit could not but ſend divers of the Spectators to the peruſals of thoſe places
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:171178:49"/>of the Prophets forementioned, <hi>Iſai</hi> 11.2.42.1, 2, 3.61.1. eſpecially Chriſt ſo interpreting the viſible deſcent of the Spirit upon him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4 18.</p>
               <p>To conclude, by this viſible ſign of a Dove is ſhewn, that Chriſt is that harmleſs one in whom the Spirit hath his conſtant reſidence; in and through whom alone we are to receive of the gifts of his Spirit, for whoſe ſake rather than for his own (in whom the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelt bodily) this Spirit deſcended upon him, and eſpecially for <hi>John</hi>'s ſake, to whom this ſign was promiſed, whereby he ſhould be certified in a moſt abſolute clearneſs of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Meſsiah. John</hi> 1.32. <hi>On whom thou ſhalt ſee the Spirit deſcending like a Dove, that ſame is he.</hi> This Spirit <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to ſee, not eſſentially, but believingly; for by a <hi>Metonymie</hi> the name of the ſpiritual thing is given to the viſible ſign.</p>

               <p>We have here the third ſign confirming the Call of Chriſt, and his Inſtalment into his Office, <hi>viz.</hi> a voice from Heaven, when the Heavens clove that voice ſounded. It was the voice of the Father doubtleſs, in that he ſaith, <hi>This is my beloved Son:</hi> here was the firſt clear Revelation of the Trinity under the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> the Father ſhews himſelf in a voice, the Son in the fleſh or humane nature, the Spirit in the likeneſs of a Dove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is my beloved Son]</hi> Not an adoptive but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; my onely everlaſting and coequal Son. Theſe words are partly taken out of the ſecond <hi>Pſalm v.</hi> 7. <hi>I will declare the Decree the Lord ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son.</hi> By this forementioned voice he made his Son King upon <hi>Sion</hi> That <hi>Pſalm</hi> is to be referred to this.</p>
               <p>Of this beloved Son, <hi>Iſaak</hi> was a Type, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Take thy ſon, thy onely ſon,</hi> thy ſon whom thou loveſt. And ſo was <hi>Solomon</hi> called <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> or the beloved of the Lord. Oft

As if he ſhould ſay, Thou, my Son, onely and chiefly beloved, pleaſeſt me in all things, and that infinitely, and no man pleaſes me but by thee, yea by thee am I appeaſed with all them I have given thee, at whom I was offended by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and there is nothing in thee that diſpleaſes me. <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed me, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. but not ſo as thou doſt, for in thee I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed and reconciled to the World of Believers. The ſhew of a Dove was a dumb thing, therefore here's a voice to make all things concerning the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> out of queſtion, and alſo opening the whole Myſtery of our Redemption; for what is our Redemption but this, whereas formerly we were at enmity with God, now God is well pleaſed with us in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> Theſe words are taken out of <hi>Iſai</hi> 42.1. and in that Chapter is the calling and ſending of Chriſt to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry deſcribed, and indeed the whole Scripture whence ſome words are taken ſhould be lookt into.</p>
               <p>To this in the Transfiguration was added <hi>Hear him,</hi> not <hi>Plato, Socrates, Moſes,</hi> further than he Witneſſes of Chriſt, but hear him who being <hi>in my boſom, John</hi> 1.18. ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal my Myſteries which have been hid from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.

               <p>IN this Chapter there are four parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Chriſt his Tentation, from <hi>v.</hi> 1. to <hi>v.</hi> 12. 2 Chriſt's Preaching in <hi>Galilee,</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 12. to <hi>v.</hi> 18. 3 Chriſt's calling of four Diſciples, <hi>Peter, Andrew, James, John.</hi> 4 The Confirmation of his Doctrine by Miracles, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>In the Temptation obſerve, 1 The Time, <hi>v.</hi> 1. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Baptiſm. 2 The Place, in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>v.</hi> 1. 3 The efficient Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of God. 4 The End, to be tempted of the Devil, <hi>v.</hi> 1. 5 The kindes of the Temptations, which are three, 1 To Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. 2 To Preſumption, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down, for he ſhall give his Angels charge of thee.</hi> 3 To the vain glory of the glory of the World, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The Victory Chriſt got over theſe Temptations, ſo that the Devil was forced to give ground, <hi>v</hi> 11. amplified from the Weapon wherewith Chriſt overcame him, which was the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The comfort Chriſt had after the Temptation was over, The Angels came and miniſtred to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>Then was</hi> Jeſus <hi>led up of the Spirit into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be tempted of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Temptation of Chriſt is ſet down, 1 From the Time <hi>Then</hi>] When? Even preſently after his Baptiſm, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.12. <hi>Immediately the Spirit driveth him into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and being full of the Holy Ghoſt he was led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the Wilderneſs.</hi> So that in the ſame day he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized he began his Faſt of forty days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was led of the Spirit]</hi> 2 His Tentation is ſet down from the efficient Cauſe, <hi>v.</hi> 12. the Spirit, <hi>He was led of the Spirit,</hi> or driven or caſt out by the Spirit, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:171178:50"/>ſet down the violent impulſion and force of the Spirit in his heart, as appears <hi>Luke</hi> 4.1. Jeſus <hi>being full of the Holy Ghoſt returned from</hi> Jordan, <hi>and was led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſs.</hi> It was not then Satan that led him, but the Spirit of God. Whether carried through the air, as <hi>Elias,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.16. and <hi>Ezekiel cap.</hi> 3.12. and <hi>Philip</hi> when he was taken from the Eunuch, or whether he went on his feet, I leave it in the midſt; but from the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>duco,</hi> I incline to think he was carried up into the air.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Whither he was led, <hi>viz. [Into the Wilderneſs]</hi> It's like the great Wilderneſs, where he was with the wilde Beaſts, yet are not any perſons to live in Wilderneſſes now for Penance, for though every action of Chriſt be for our inſtruction, yet is it not for our imitation. What popiſh Eremite is ſo carried as Chriſt was? Chriſt went into the Wilderneſs to teſtifie his divine glory, in abſtinence, not onely from fleſh, but from all manner of meat, which hath no place in Eremites: he went to be tempted of the Devil, and therefore choſe the fitteſt place, even a ſolitary Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. We pray that we may not be led into Tentation. If there were any ſuch end of an Eremitical or Wilderneſs Life, as Penance, yet were it meet to be profeſt rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men than beaſts, that they who have beheld our Fall, may behold our Repentance. And if the Warrant of a Wilderneſs Life be fetcht from the Example of Chriſt, it muſt of neceſſity be ſhut up in the ſpace of forty days and forty nights; after the end of which forty days Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he lived the reſt of his life in the ſociety of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be tempted of the Devil]</hi> This was the end Chriſt was led into the Wilderneſs. Chriſt was thus tempted, firſt, that he might be fitted for his Miniſtry by Tentations; for knowledg of Tentations is one great requiſite to make an able Teacher. 2 To ſhew with what Weapons a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to oppoſe the Temptations of the Devil. 3 That
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:171178:51"/>he might be ſuccouring and helpfull to us in our Tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>For that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 To ſhew that Chriſt is ſtronger than Satan in time of Tentation, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.4. Chriſtians overcome, becauſe greater is he that is in them, than he that is in the World.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That we may come unto him with boldneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, ſeeing he was in all the principal points of Tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tempted as well as we, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>He was in all points tempted like unto us, let us come therefore unto him with boldneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 Satan tempted Chriſt, that in overcoming Chriſt he might hinder the Work of our Redemption, by drawing him to ſin; for the high Prieſt that was to redeem us was to be <hi>holy, and harmleſs, and undefiled. Heb.</hi> 7.26.</p>
               <p n="7">7 That by his combating with Satan he might obtain victory to us, <hi>John</hi> 14. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 To let young Converts ſee, that after Baptiſm, that is, the profeſſion of a ſincere and holy life, Temptations hang over ſuch.</p>
               <p n="9">9 To let us ſee, that bare Tentations are not ſins, unleſs we give our conſent to them. Satans Temptations to evil are our croſſes and Satan's ſins, provided we groan under them and oppoſe them. In holy men God works a diſtaſte of Satans Temptations, yet may a Saint have as horrid thoughts caſt into his heart as the Devil can invent, who is indeed the great temptation-maſter.</p>
               <p n="10">10 That we, by Chriſt his Example, may learn to fight it out with Satan and not to give way, like valiant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that ſtand and maintain their ground againſt their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Learn we from this, ſeeing Chriſt was led or driven of the Spirit to his Tentation, that we do not raſhly caſt our ſelves into Tentations, becauſe we know not what weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we may ſhew therein.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:171178:51"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 2 <hi>And when he had faſted forty days and forty nights, he was afterwards an hungred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he had faſted forty days]</hi> Chriſt his temptation is amplified from the concomitants that accompanied his temptation, which was prayer and faſting. Becauſe faſting kindles prayer, therefore he uſed faſting, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> had communion with the Lord miraculouſly, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.18. forty days and forty nights, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8. ſo had Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>From hence Papiſts ſtabliſh Lent. They ſay Chriſt his example is a command for us, but by this reaſon all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Chriſt ſhould be inſtead of a command, but who can imitate Chriſt in miracles? <hi>Moſes</hi> at the receiving of the Law, and <hi>Eliah</hi> at the reſtoring of it, and Chriſt the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the new Law, faſted forty days apiece, but what is this to us? The example of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> gave no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the Jews to imitate that faſt, no more doth Chriſts faſt give warrant to us to imitate that.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There is great difference between Chriſt his faſts and Papiſts; for Chriſt faſted but once, they yearly; Chriſt abſtained from all meat and drink, they onely from fleſh and that which comes of it; Chriſt abſtained from food without need or appetite to it, they hunger when they faſt: Beſides in their faſts the Shambles are onely chang'd into Fiſhmarkets, or into Grocers and Comfit-makers ſhops, which are more pampering to the fleſh. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, that in thoſe forty days Chriſt did eat nothing, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.2. but they eat every day.</p>
               <p>Now for the faſt of Chriſt it was ſupernatural. For to faſt above ſeven days is death; for though ſick perſons in whom there is abundance of ſlimy phlegm, and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat is weak, may live above ſeven days without meat, for they are nouriſhed of the moiſture of the body and phlegm, which the little heat in their body doth ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat up. Yet man naturally cannot live without meat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:171178:52"/>days, becauſe for want of nouriſhment the natural heat dies. As the fire of a Lamp is put out for want of oyl, the body alſo being dried becomes unfit, that the ſoul ſhould inform it; beſides, the bowels (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſerves) wanting chylous moiſture growes together and then the man dies.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt, his divine power did keep his body ſtrong without hunger, and did likewiſe ſuſpend the action of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, and other contrary qualities weakning one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in the mean time afforded ſtrength and animal ſpirits to the head and brain, which were neceſſary to the contemplation of 40 days: For though Chriſts natural heat might be ſuſpended by his deep contemplation ſo that he might ſlowly digeſt (for the powers of the ſoul when they go into contemplation they have little left for digeſtion and nouriſhment (as we ſee generally in great ſtudents) and ſo might keep him alive without meat the longer, yet not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was afterwards an hungred]</hi> When Chriſt began to be hungry the tempter came to him: hitherto he ſtood doubtful, and durſt not come, partly becauſe of the voice he had heard out of heaven, and partly becauſe his forty dayes faſt did portend ſome great thing, but now ſeeing Chriſt to be hungry he comes the more impudently; as he came to the head ſo to the members, when the feeling of affliction begins to touch them. He was not hungry all the forty days, but after, he was hungry to ſhow he was man. Some think Chriſt by his hunger did objectively allure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to tempt him, that ſo he might overcome him, as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſouldiers ſometimes feign a running away that they may allure the enemies to follow them, and ſo cut them off, either by an ambuſh, or by an orderly facing about, ſo the devil tempted Chriſt as man, not knowing him to be God, or if he did know him to be God, Chriſt doth as it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his cowardly enemy that durſt not ſet upon him as God, ſhewing himſelf to be man.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:171178:52"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>And when the tempter came to him, he ſaid, If thou be the Son of God command that theſe ſtones be made bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have here the firſt of the three temptations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the devil aſſaults Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when the tempter]</hi> So he is called, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. from the firſt temptation wherewith he ſupplanted <hi>Eve,</hi> he is called the Tempter; not becauſe he is the alone tempter, but becauſe he is the chiefeſt, for ſometimes our fleſh, and ſometimes the world tempts. This tempting of Satan was nor barely by way of ſuggeſtion, for that would eaſily have been repelled from the holy heart of Chriſt, but in ſome outward and bodily form, perhaps of a man. To tempt is to try, but Satan is an enſnaring trier.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaid unto him, If thou be the Son of God]</hi> Meaning, as that voice at thy baptiſm declared, and as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> hath preached thee to be; do not thou ſuffer hunger having whereby thou mayeſt aſſwage thy hunger. Satan thought, either by the miracle, or by Chriſts inability to do the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, he might know whether he were the Son of God or no, that ſo he might vent his old wrath and envy againſt him.</p>
               <p>It's like the devil did not come abruptly upon him, but firſt ſaluted him courteouſly, as what, Sir, art thou medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of? I ſaw thee to be baptized of <hi>John</hi> in Jordan, I heard a voice from heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> I would fain know whether the voice meant that thou art truly the Son of God by nature, or an adopted Son by grace. I ſee alſo by thy long faſt of forty days that thou art hungry, if therefore thou art the Son of God ſuccour thy hunger, and turn theſe ſtones into bread, for thou canſt eaſily do it.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of Satans temptation was to tempt Chriſt, 1 To unbelief, as if he ſhould ſay, Thy father hath hitherto forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ten thee, and ſent thee no meat, now thou ſeeſt thy
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:171178:53"/>God fails thee, therefore neceſſity puts thee upon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for thy ſelf. The ſcope of Satan was to draw Chriſt from reſting on Gods word, and to follow what unbelief ſhould ſuggeſt, and this appears by Chriſt his anſwer, <hi>Man doth not live by bread alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that though I will not deny but Satan might tempt Chriſt to a vain boaſting of his own power, yet ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he tempts Chriſt to unbelief, either that he ſhould not believe that teſtimony that was given at his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or to doubt that God would fail him of neceſſary livelihood: As he overcame the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> with unbelief of the threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.3. ſo doth he endeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> with unbelief of the promiſe. And ſeeing Satan dare call in queſtion the Son-ſhip of Chriſt, no wonder if he tempt Saints to call in queſtion their ſon-ſhip.</p>
               <p>Where we may ſee Satans craft. Chriſt being hungry is tempted to provide bread in ſuch a way as Satan preſcribes. He uſually fits his temptations according to mens preſent conditions, marking in his temptation whereunto perſons are inclining, or wherein they are wanting; ſo that as Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers lay ſeveral baits for the birds, and Hunters for the wilde beaſts, and Fiſhers for the fiſh, and lays for every one their proper bait for to catch them, ſo to the hungry or poor, Satan ſets before them bread and livelihood; to the full, idleneſs and ſloth; to the proud, honours; to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, gain; to the revengefull, wrongs and diſcontents; to the curious, Magick and inch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntments; to the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, beauty; to the drunkard, wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he tempted the head ſo doth he the members; to the afflicted, deſpair; to the idle wantonneſs; to the buſie, trouble; to the ſevere, cruelty; to the mercifull, flattery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>But be anſwered and ſaid, Man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:171178:53"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he anſwered and ſaid]</hi> We may ſee the defence Chriſt had againſt Satans temptation, it was the Scripture: for that is our ſword we are to fight with, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. which the Papiſts taking from the people, expoſe them to Satans open violence. A man that is to go where thievs way-lay him will be ſure to have his ſword; yet is not the bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the word in an heartleſs manner a defence againſt Satan, but to repeat it believingly, after which the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation uſes preſently to vaniſh.</p>
               <p>But herein we muſt joyn precept, promiſe and threat; precept, forbidding ſuch a ſin and commanding ſuch a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the promiſe, in caſe we conſent not, nor obey Satans temptations, this we muſt ſet againſt all Satans proffers; the threatning in caſe we yield to the temptation: becauſe <hi>Eve</hi> ſet not the threatning againſt the devils temptation, and minc'd off the temptation, which was, <hi>In the day thou eats thereof thou ſhalt die,</hi> which ſhe minc'd into this, Leſt ye die, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.3. ſhe was overcome of the tempter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God]</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Man ſhall live of every thing which the Lord hath commanded or appointed to the ſuſtenance of mans life, and not onely of bread, as the Jews lived of Manna 40 years. So that if the Lord ſhould command us to eat graſs and ſnakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhould live by them as by the moſt delicate meat: yea, if he ſhould command it, we ſhould live without any meat, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did. Therefore by word here, is not onely meant the promiſes, but the decree, for the word that goes out of a man is his will, pleaſure or decree. So that by word is meant the decree of God, which he hath publiſhed for the nouriſhing the creatures. Now Chriſt herein doth not anſwer to that which the devil kept ſilent, which was, the devil deſired to know whether he were the Son of God or no, but onely to what he ſpake, which was, <hi>to command that theſe ſtones ſhould be made bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:171178:54"/>
               <p>So that firſt Gods promiſes are not to be meaſured by the want of bodily things, for God is able to make a new meat for us to live upon. 2 When ſecond cauſes are wanting, we muſt not depart from the faith of a promiſe to be helped by a miracle, but we muſt live upon that word, for God will rather work a miracle, then fail of a promiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every word]</hi> That is, every divine command, whether general or ſpecial, wherein there is an expreſs or ſilent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of neceſſary things. <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſtir up the Jews to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Law, tells them, God would give them things that were needfull, either by ordinary means or by extraordinary, as he had done when he fed them with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, which Chriſt applies to himſelf, when the devil lyingly would make him believe that he ſhould periſh, if he turned not ſtones into bread.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy City, and ſetteth him on a Pinacle of the Temple;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>And ſaith unto him, If thou be the Son of God caſt thy thy ſelf down, for it is written, He ſhall give his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the ſecond temptation wherewith the devil aſſaulteth Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the devil taketh him and ſetteth him on a Pinacle of the Temple]</hi> It's queſtioned whether the matter were onely in viſion? <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was a real rapture of the body of Chriſt through the permiſſion of God, neither was this any diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Chriſt, for that the devil carried him through the ayr and ſet him upon a Pinacle, neither is this any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be ſo uſed, ſeeing he ſuffered himſelf to be crucified of the Jews.</p>
               <p>Now though the devil did ſo take Chriſt that he might be ſeen of all, yet Chriſt (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſervs) did ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly act (the devil not knowing it) that he could be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:171178:54"/>of no man, either by hindering the ſight of his body, or the ſight of their eys. Yet was the devil notably mockt, for he thought if Chriſt were the Son of God he would not ſuffer himſelf to be taken up by him, and carried through the ayr, and thence he ſhould know whether he were the Son of God or no; but Chriſt concealing his Godhead, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his body to be taken up by the devil, and ſo fruſtrated the devils expectation and left him ſtill in doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Into the holy City]</hi> He means <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> called <hi>the holy City, Matth.</hi> 27.53. <hi>the beloved City, Revel.</hi> 20.9. <hi>the City Jeruſalem,</hi> called Gods <hi>holy Mountain, Dan.</hi> 9.16. <hi>the City of the great King, Matth.</hi> 5.35. <hi>the City of God, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of holineſs, Pſal.</hi> 48.1.</p>

                  <hi>And ſetteth him on a Pinacle of the Temple]</hi> A Pinacle is the top of a building with a ſharp point, yet hath it ſome breadth upon it, wherein a man may ſtand. Others think the Temple to be plain with a battlement, and ſo all their houſes were commanded to be made, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.8. Thence Satan tempted Chriſt to throw down himſelf, as if he ſhould ſay, Show by this miraculous fall to all that thou remaineſt not hurt, that thou art the Son of God, and ſo all the people will acknowledge thee for the <hi>Meſsias.</hi> We ſee the devil hath no power to compell, no not in the height of his temptation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thou be the Son of God caſt thy ſelf down]</hi> A true voice of the devil. The voice of God is to all believers, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to the Jaylor, <hi>Do thy ſelf no harm,</hi> but ſatan ſays, caſt thy ſelf down. All temptations of ſelf-deſtruction come from ſatan. Againſt theſe let us reaſon,</p>
               <p n="1">1 We muſt not kill another, much leſs our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We read not that Saints, but wicked men, to have kild themſelves, as <hi>Judas, Saul, Achitophel.</hi> For <hi>Jonah,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon,</hi> they did it by private motion, or elſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically they knew the minde of God.

An example is of no force, unleſs it be like in all things.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Take heed of Satans reaſons; As its likely Satan brought this reaſon to Chriſt; Thou dependeſt upon the providence of God in thy greateſt hunger and want, now depend upon the ſame providence in bearing thee up, if thou fall down from the pinacle. So Satan comes to many ſouls, Make away thy ſelf, its ſoon done, the pain is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſt, thou art like to lie in anguiſh all thy life; the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thou lives the more will the ſcore of thy ſins be, and thy torments in hell more. If it be once done it will appear to be Gods decree, and I hope thou wilt not be againſt the accompliſhment of that; if thou live longer thou wilt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy ſins, and make away thy ſelf at laſt. Do not then reaſon with Satan, but paſs eaſily from his ſuggeſtions by diverſion of thoughts, alſo ſlight them, they oftener (as ſome think) go away by ſlighting then by force. As its moſt ſafe to paſs by a barking Dog and to contemn him, ſo one way of overcoming is to deſpiſe Satans ſuggeſtions, and not to diſpute long with them, ſo will they fall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the more you rowl them in your minde, the more vehement are they; beſides Satan can bear nothing worſe then contempt, <hi>Luth. Tom.</hi> 3.376.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Labour to draw good out of ſuch helliſh ſuggeſtions, and ſo Satan will be weary of ſuch tempting, as to ſpend the time with leſs ſin with them then without them.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Conſider, God will require blood at the hand of man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.5. not onely at the hand of him that ſlays his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but at the hand of a man ſelf: now if God require it, what a wofull condition art thou in, ſeeing if God enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgement for one ſin with us, we are undone.</p>

               <p n="6">6 As ſouldiers are not to leave their ſtation without the command of their Officers, no more are we to go out of the body when we pleaſe. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks in the perſon of <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſella</hi> that kild her ſelf, I will not receive thoſe ſouls which have gone out of the body againſt my will. <hi>Job</hi> and the Apoſtles who were ſtill under perſecutions, never thought to ſhorten their troubles this way; and therefore though ſome heathens lookt on life as a banquet, from which they might riſe full and then go away, or as a play which a man may leave when he liſt, yet ought we not to go from life till God call us.

                  <hi>For it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee]</hi> We may ſee Satans malice and craft in abuſing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to take away, if poſſible, Chriſts life.

               <p>Onely Satans deceit is to be noted, that in citing <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. he leaves out theſe words, <hi>To keep thee in all thy wayes</hi>] that is, in the ways of thy calling. And Satan applies it to actions done without our calling, without command, without neceſſity, meerly of preſumption.

               <p>Chriſt ſhews that Satans ſtrange Interpretation of this Scripture was contrary to other Scriptures.

               <p>

               <p n="1">1 To tempt God, is to require an Experiment of his Power, other than he hath appointed. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.18. the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when God gave them Manna to nouriſh them, they not content herewith, tempted God by asking Meat for their Luſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To tempt God, is to impoſe a Law upon the Creator, and to alter his Appointment, when God ſhall give us ſuch means to maintain and preſerve us and we will ſeek for other.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To tempt God, is when out of preſumption, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity, we ſeek the experiment of his power, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, goodneſs and truth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.2. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 7. they tempted the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Is the Lord amongſt us or not?</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a Promiſe that God would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them in the Wilderneſs, but now, when they wanted Water, in their thirſt they cry out, If God do not now give us Water to drink, we will not believe he is in the midſt of us.</p>

               <p n="7">7 By deſiring a needleſs Miracle; ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> would have Chriſt ſhew a ſign that they may believe on him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> gave their fathers Manna in the Wilderneſs, <hi>John</hi> 6.30. Chriſt had given them a ſufficient ſign herein, but that would not content them, they had ſeen Chriſt feed five thouſand men with five Barley Loaves and two Fiſhes, yet muſt they have a ſign.</p>
               <p>Divers of theſe ways, if not all, the Devil tempts Chriſt, as to work a needleſs Miracle; to throw himſelf headlong, that the Angels might take him up in their hands; to caſt himſelf down, when there were ſteps to go down. In ſum, Chriſt lets Satan ſee the Promiſes of God are ſo to be taken and applied that we do not tempt God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>Again the Devil taketh him into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the third Tentation Satan brings to Chriſt, which is the preſentment unto him the glory of the World, with which Chriſt's ſenſes were ſo delighted, that no Luſt or inordinate affection was in his heart; Satan ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World and the glory of them in a moment of time, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.5. Satan ſhewed unto Chriſt the multitude of Nations, the excellency of Cities, the riches, attendance, and glory of Princes Courts, that ſo Chriſt ſeeing them might deſire them, and deſiring them might fall down and worſhip him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sheweth him all the Kingdoms of the World]</hi> Some think Satan ſhewed them by pointing at them with his finger, and that Satan told Chriſt by words in what thing every Kingdom excelled. Others think the Devil flew with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:171178:57"/>Chriſt through all the Kingdoms of the World, and in a little time ſhewed them to him. But the Text ſaith, The Devil took him into an high Mountain and ſhewed them to him. Some think the Devil by an imaginary Viſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented all the Kingdoms of the World. But this Tentation was outward, not inward. Therefore I lean to the firſt, that the Devil from that high Mountain ſhewed Chriſt onely the coaſt and ſituation of all the quarters and Kingdoms of the World, ſaying, this is <hi>Europe,</hi> this is <hi>Africk,</hi> this <hi>Aſia,</hi> this <hi>England,</hi> this <hi>France, Spain, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe he ſhewed him the glory of them, it's like the Devil like a Painter repreſented unto Chriſt all the glorious things that were in every Kingdom, by thickening of the air, wherein the Devil made certain Images of things which were no leſs apparent to Chriſt, than Colours in the Rain-bowe to us, for neither were the eys, nor imagination of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Satan ſhewed the Kingoms of the World by way of proportion, ſhewing the wealth, pomp, and glory of ſome one Kingdom, that was nigh that high Mountain. For the Kingdoms of the World have onely a greater quantity of that which may be ſeen in one Kingdom.</p>
               <p>We may by the way obſerve the order of the Tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The firſt Tentation was of Diſtruſt, from which Satan being driven away by the Promiſe, the Devil ſets upon Chriſt by a ſecond, which was, If thou aſcribe ſo much to the Promiſe, then <hi>caſt thy ſelf down, for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee.</hi> His third Tentation was taken out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſsion,</hi> which though it were the ſpeech of the Father to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet ſo much Satan gathered, that all the Nations of the World belonged to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Devil therefore ſhews them to him, as if he ſhould ſay to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> That way thou goeſt in humbling thy ſelf, thou ſhalt never
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:171178:58"/>ſubject the Kingdoms of the World to thy ſelf, for thou ſeeſt they are poſſeſt of them that are my Servants, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou wilt worſhip me, thou mayſt become Lord and Heir of all theſe Kingdoms, more eaſily, ſpeedily, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than if thou truſteſt to that voice that ſounded unto thee from Heaven.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here is the Devils proffer to Chriſt, <hi>All theſe things will I give thee;</hi> The condition, <hi>If thou wilt fall down &amp; worſhip me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>All theſe things will I give thee]</hi> In this Proffer, ſee the Devils Lyes, 1 He challenges that to be his which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Chriſt, for he is <hi>Heir of all things, Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>All power is given unto him in Heaven and Earth, Matth.</hi> 28.19. 2 That he had power to give the Kingdoms of the World to whom he will, as <hi>Luke</hi> ſets it down. Whereas this onely is Gods property, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.25. for though Satan be called <hi>the Prince of the World, John</hi> 12.31.14.30. and <hi>the God of this World,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. yet this is meant onely of the World of the Wicked, in whom he reigns, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. Not that he is Proprietary of any Kingdom of the World.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:171178:58"/>Son of God, for it's like he reaſoned thus, If this <hi>Chriſt</hi> be the Son of God he will be angry at me for taking his Dignity from him, and counterfeiting my ſelf to be Gods Son, wherefore being angry he will reply, whence is this arrogance of thine? how dares thou thus blaſphemouſly ſpeak, thou proud and lying ſpirit? I am the Son of God, thou art Satan; it's thy duty to worſhip me, how dares thou then require me to worſhip thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thou wilt fall down and worſhip me]</hi> Here is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: None get any thing of the Devil at a cheap rate. For falling down in worſhip it was the manner of the Eaſtern People, not onely to their Kings but to their God, yea it was the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo to worſhip God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 95.6. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.5. <hi>Nathan</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>David</hi> about <hi>Adoniſah</hi>'s reigning, he fell on his face to the ground, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.23. That outward ſign of Reverence was not proper to divine worſhip, when it was uſed out of divine worſhip. We may know when it is done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now there being no manner of Worſhip, neither civil, nor divine, due to Satan, Chriſt abhorred ſo much as to give him civil Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Now for the Tentations wherein he tempted <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they were 1 To Covetouſneſs, for the Devil knows how unſatiable the heart of man is after earthly things, and to many the Devil need not proffer ſo largely, neither a houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Gold as <hi>Balaam,</hi> nor all the Kingdoms of the World for a handfull of Gold, nay a far leſs matter will ſerve the turn.</p>

Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous words ſhould not be patiently heard of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, no more than they were of Chriſt, but to be rejected with great indignation.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:171178:59"/>
               <p>Alſo we may learn when the Devil grows troubleſom with blaſphemous Temptations, not to diſpute with him, but to drive him away with anger, ſaying with one of the Ancients, Thy uncleanneſs be upon thee, O Satan, becauſe thou art an unclean Spirit, uncleanneſs is thy work. Let not Satans blaſphemous thoughts which he caſts into thee, fill thee with doubting, whether ſuch Injections can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall Gods children, and ſo put thee into an habit of heavy walking: but drive him back as Chriſt doth by the Word. Satan being he cannot torment Saints in Hell, will labour to torment them here on Earth.</p>
               <p>It's a point of wiſdom to draw ſome ſpiritual good out of Satans blaſphemous Tentations: When he ſuggeſts there is no God, ſay, Nay Satan, the Word to which I am confined ſays there is; beſides in the Lights of Heaven I ſee a ſhadow of his divine countenance, in the Creation of the World I ſee his infinite greatneſs, in his univerſal provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I ſee his goodneſs, let theſe motions make us ſee Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans malice that he hath againſt the Majeſty of God, let us alſo with more dearneſs adore and love the Majeſty of God. Be alſo humbled that thou canſt not with greater ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency abominate ſuch helliſh Blaſphemies, alſo ſtrive to be more ſtrongly ſettled that there is a God, that there is a Heaven and Hell, becauſe Satan endeavours to inſtill the contrary. Let it alſo be a ſtrong Argument that thou in more likelihood than formerly belongs unto God, for ſo long as thou lieſt dead in thy ſins the Devil never affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee with blaſphemous thoughts; but now ſince thou cameſt home to God, and beganneſt to imbrace his ways. Beſides, gather experience by theſe blaſphemous thoughts to comfort others in the ſame kinde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God]</hi> The meaning of Chriſt's words are, thoſe things which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to the Worſhip of God are not to be given to any Creature, neither ought a Diſpute concerning any ſuch
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:171178:60"/>thing to be received, but angerly to be rejected, as Chriſt here doth. Yea thoſe things which belong to Worſhip they are to be given to no Creature, nor to be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Creatures. This place is taken out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. in ſtead of Worſhip there it is Fear, <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God;</hi> for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> put Fear for all the Worſhip of God, hence <hi>Rabbi Juda in libro Chaſidim</hi> ſaith, If any man ſee the Devil and be afrid of him he falls down before him.</p>

And therefore the popiſh diſtinction of Adoration which they acknowledg onely to be given to God, and that of Invocation, wherein they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg Saints may give good things, and drive away evil, is vain. All Invocation preſuppoſes three things, 1 Omniſcience, that he that is called on may hear our Groans. 2 Omnipreſence, that he every where hears our Prayers. 3 Omnipotence, that he can ſuccour us in our miſeries: now can Saints departed do any of theſe? and therefore why ſhould they be invoked? and therefore that it's not lawful to give divine Service or Worſhip to any ſave God onely, Ile give theſe Reaſons.</p>

               <p n="5">5 It darkens and derogates from Chriſt's Mediatorſhip, to whom it belongs to intercede for his People, which they blaſphemouſly aſcribe to Saints, eſpecially to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Now Chriſt alone conveys the things that are Gods to us, and miniſters the things that are ours to God. Now we are commanded to come in our Wants, not to Saint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted or Angel, but to this Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p n="6">6 By calling thus upon Saints we put them into the Throne of Chriſt, and inveſt them with Gods properties, as to hear Prayers and to know our Wants. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. We are onely to call upon him on whom we believe. Yea hereby we inveſt them with Gods properties, for we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the perſon we pray to the ſearcher of our heart, and the authour of our good. And therefore <hi>Chemnicius</hi> writes, The Papiſts in their Temples paint Chriſt threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening and caſting Darts againſt ſinners, the affrighted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they fly to <hi>Mary,</hi> who puts her ſelf betwixt as a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and drives back the Darts, this honour Chriſt gets hereby that he is leſs loved, leſs ſought, and counted leſs mercifull.</p>
               <p n="7">7 He that we call upon muſt know the ſtates of all that call upon him every where, that he may judg what is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, or not expedient for them: but this is proper to God alone, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 65.2. neither doth it help them to ſay that Saints departed know the ſtates of all by the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Angels, or in the glaſs of the Trinity, or from thoſe that dy, for our Prayers ought not to be founded on ſuch Dreams, but on plain Scriptures, and ſo much more in that the Saints the Papiſts call upon are ſcarcely any where to be found, ſave in the Popes Kalender.</p>
               <p>Yet do we not think ſlightly or ſpeak reproachfully of the Saints departed, whoſe Memories are celebrated in Scripture, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106.16. for there's Memory of Saint <hi>Moſes</hi> and Saint <hi>Aaron,</hi> as well as of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> Saint <hi>Mark, &amp;c.</hi> In the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> there's a Catalogue of many
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:171178:61"/>Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32. Yet doth it not follow that Saints are to be called upon; we are to praiſe God in his Saints, and to acknowledge the grace of God in them, and to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them, but not to worſhip them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.23. Neither that divine benefits may deſcend upon us through their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation; nor as helpers together or workers together with Chriſt in the work of our ſalvation, or that they plead our cauſe with God, by offering their merits for to obtain our ſalvation, or that they obtain pardon of ſin or the grace of God to us, which Popiſh Writers make the ends of invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints; All which ends are blaſphemouſly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the glory of Chriſts merits and interceſſion. Thus are men more ready to do all things, which either themſelves chuſe, or men have ordained, then thoſe things which God hath commanded, becauſe in the commands of men, the old man is untoucht, yea is nouriſhed by the commands of men, but in the commands of God it is mortified.</p>
               <p>It were endleſs to ſet down the multiplication of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, to ſhow all the ends Papiſts give of calling upon Saints, as becauſe Chriſt is a more hard and juſt Judge, therefore we muſt have mediators to come to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we want deſerts, that therefore the Saints would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the deſerts which they have more then enough for themſelves unto us, to interpoſe them betwixt Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and our unworthineſs, that ſo we may be made wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the promiſes of God. Moreover they teach that all the benefits we want are beſtowed of God upon the bleſſed in heaven, that they being implored may give all things which belong to this life and the life to come. Men are taught in their neceſſities to flye to the grace, mercy and help of Saints, and to place their faith and hope in them, alſo they think the bleſſed in heaven know every mans vows and the thoughts of their mindes.</p>
               <p>Now this invocation of Saints, 1 is no where in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Hence Chriſt brands the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> they worſhipped
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:171178:61"/>they knew not what. Now Scripture tells us that God onely in the name of Chriſt is to be called upon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16.7.25.13.15. Now it muſt needs be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to go from the rule of the word for prayer. 2 They inveſt the Saints departed with thoſe things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God, as to be a refuge, a deliverer, to give good things which God onely gives, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. to flye to them in prayer for grace and mercy. 3 Papiſts derogate from Chriſts interceſſion, which is one part of his Prieſthood, for whereas we for our ſins are unworthy to come into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with our prayers or perſons, God hath given Chriſt as a mediator to appear in our behalf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17.7.25.9.24. Papiſts call upon Saints directly, that they would interpoſe their merits betwixt Gods juſtice and our unworthineſs.</p>
               <p>For 200 years after Chriſt, there was no news of invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints, <hi>Juſtin Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>Tert. Apol. c,</hi> 30. <hi>Iren. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 58. About the year 240 <hi>Origen</hi> was the firſt that began to ſow the ſeeds of invocation of Saints, who, as <hi>Hierom</hi> obſerves, brought in many poyſonous opinions into the Church of Chriſt, and in that age it began onely to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and <hi>Origen</hi> from ſome Apocryphical Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think it might be ſo, and after manifeſtly to affirm it; but he affirms, theſe aſſertions were onely private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but not the received opinions of the Church. <hi>Orig. l.</hi> 2. <hi>in Roman.</hi> and in his diſputation againſt <hi>Celſus</hi> he doth in effect deny it. In <hi>Cyprians</hi> time invocation of Saints about the year 250 took another ſtep; for <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others ſpoke to the living Saints before they departed out of this life, that after death they would be mindfull of them with God, <hi>Cypr. l.</hi> 1. <hi>ep.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Cornel. l.</hi> 2. <hi>de habitu Virg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this while they were not called upon after death, but about the year 370, by occaſion of Panegyrical Orations that were made at the deceaſe of friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it began to be brought into the Church by <hi>Baſil, Nyſſen</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen,</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:171178:62"/>bringing it from the private devotions of Monks, into open aſſemblies. And in their Panegyrical orations, they cald up the ſouls of them whoſe memory they celebrated, and ſo <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calls up the ſoul of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet muſt we know that theſe opinions were not received every where, and of all, for true opinions; yea the very Authors hereof in their ſtrains of Rhetorick do not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their doubts, that the Saints in heaven pray'd for thoſe here; Hence they uſe theſe words, <hi>As I think,</hi> and, <hi>As I perſwade my ſelf,</hi> and, <hi>If it be not a raſh thing to ſay it,</hi> and ſo that phraſe here, Thou ſoul of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> if thou haſt any underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Yea this opinion in that time was ſtrongly oppoſed by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and put into the Catalogue of Hereſies, and he inveighs againſt it in his book againſt the <hi>Collyridians.</hi> And <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in many places inveighs againſt the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the common people, who neglecting repentance and godlineſs, caſt all the buſineſs of hearing their prayers and ſalvation upon the interceſſion of others. <hi>Hom.</hi> 44. <hi>in Gen. Hom.</hi> 5. <hi>in Matth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Synod of <hi>Laodicca,</hi> about the year 368, ſaith, It behoves not Chriſtians, the Church being left, to go away, and to make Congregations of Idolatry to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, all which are forbid: whoſoever ſhall be found at this hidden Idolatry let him be accurſed, becauſe leaving our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God he goes to Idols.</p>

               <p>To conclude, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> falling into thoſe times wherein all perſons were full of preſumptions, was forced to give way to the times, yet did he endeavour to call perſons back to call upon the name of God, when he durſt not freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the commonly received preſumptions, <hi>l. cont.

               </p>
               <p>This preſumption then prevail'd, that the ſouls of the bleſſed heard prayers, and brought them to God, and beſtowed benefits, and therefore they came together to their graves to pray to them; but he concludes againſt this, that ſouls departed know not things done here, and he was ſure that if it were ſo, his mother would no night forſake him, which he found otherwiſe. In a word, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was againſt invocation of Saints, ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in ſome ſuppoſititious writings falſely aſcribed unto him.</p>

               <p>We have here the victory over the tempter. The devil brought the worſt of his fiery darts, but Chriſt overcomes him. We may ſee the temptations of Satan are limited, that God will not ſtill ſuffer Satan to tempt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. nor us to be tempted above ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> adds, when the devil had ended all the temptation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e departed from him for a ſeaſon. Satan left not Chriſt altogether, but onely for a ſeaſon, to let us know that the reſt of his life was not free from temptations, and to teach
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:171178:63"/>us that ſometimes Satan politickly gives way, to try after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whether he can finde us ſecure. Satan will try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have not loſt our former ſtrength, care or vigilance, or whether God that now doth not, will not at another time, for ſome cauſes, ſuffer us to be led into temptation. Satan would come oftner, but that God who knoweth our ſtrength, or rather our weakneſs, will not ſuffer him. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is apt to come again with the ſame temptation, to ſee if he cannot tyre and weary us out with the anguiſh and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. Satan thrice tempted <hi>Paul</hi> with pride: and ſometimes he changes his weapon. Let us do as the Pilot doth, have our compaſs ready, and ſtand ready to turn your needle to any point, knowing that your luſt within is for any ſin, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can as eaſily tempt us to prodigality as to covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Onely when Satan comes with ſome other weapon God doth it for our good; as change of Phyſick is good for the body, for the ſame Potion always uſed will not work ſo well, ſo the longer we are uſed to the ſame temptation the leſs it worketh. God will have Satan turn ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, to purge ſome other ſtream of luſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides, God will have us learn skill by experience at all ſorts of weapons: by the falls of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> learn we that when one temptation is over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will come, which will be a mean to prevent ſpiritual pride and ſecurity.</p>
               <p>As we muſt not be ſecure when the temptation comes, but ſet againſt it before Satans ſuggeſtion joyn with our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, ſet againſt it while it is young, ſo let us not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure when the ſtorm of the temptation is blown over, let us do as Mariners that mend their tacklings againſt another storm come. We are apt to think we ſhall have no more ſuch temptations, and then comes the tempter. Satan was never ſo beaten by any, as by Chriſt; yet he came again
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:171178:63"/>and again. A man that is once well beaten in the Field will hardly be brought to fight with the ſame man again, but it is not ſo with Satan. We muſt have ſome good days to breath in, elſe we ſhould not be willing to live, and more fits of Temptations we muſt have, or elſe we ſhould not be willing to dy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And behold the Angels came and miniſtred to him]</hi> Here's the comfort Chriſt had after the Temptation was over, Angels come to miniſter to him. Conſolations are wont to follow after Temptations. Hereby Chriſt ſaw the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had a care of him, and whereas ſolitarineſs in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs was one Trial, here's the company of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; nor had he onely their company, but alſo he had them miniſtring to him Meat and other neceſſaries till he came out of the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>[Behold]</hi> lets us ſee that this was no little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Son of God, who was even now expoſed to Satans ſcorns, ſhould have not onely one, but divers An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels miniſtring to him. The like was in his paſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. As in Battel when the Enemies are diſpoiled and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away, Friends come to congratulate with us; ſo the Devil being overcome the Angels come to rejoyce with Chriſt As the Angels miniſtred to Chriſt after his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, ſo do they ſerve Believers, they are all miniſtring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. but it's not to Run-aways, but to then who have valiantly ſtood it out.</p>

               <p>We have Chriſt's Preaching ſet forth, 1 By the time when, which was when <hi>Jeſus</hi> heard that <hi>John</hi> was caſt into Priſon, from that time Chriſt began to preach, <hi>v.</hi> 17. which was as ſoon as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> his fore-runner was caſt into Priſon: of this mention is made <hi>Acts</hi> 10.36, 37. <hi>The Word which God ſent unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>preaching peace by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>that Word you know that was publiſhed throughout all</hi> Judea, <hi>and began from</hi> Galilee <hi>after the Baptiſm which</hi> John <hi>preached.</hi> This circumſtance of time notes to us, that this <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the Lord whom they looked for, who ſent <hi>John</hi> as a Meſſenger to prepare the way of his Goſpel; which was propheſied by <hi>Iſai, cap.</hi> 40.6. and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy, cap.</hi> 4, 5, 6. Hence the Diſciples when they ſaw <hi>Elias</hi> come after <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Transfiguration, they ſcrupled, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Why do the Scribes ſay that</hi> Elias <hi>muſt firſt come?</hi> Chriſt tells them that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was that <hi>Elias</hi> the fore-runner of <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> according to thoſe words of his father <hi>Zachary, Thou Childe ſhalt be called the Prophet of the Higheſt, for thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his way:</hi> namely, (as the Angel told him) in the power and ſpirit of <hi>Elias, Luk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> 1.17. This <hi>John</hi> was Chriſt's fore-runner, both in his Birth, being born ſix Moneths before him, and in his Preaching, and alſo in his Paſſion and Suffering. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.12. Elias <hi>is come, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatſoever they liſted, even ſo alſo ſhall the Son of man ſuffer of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſeeing the coming of Chriſt is twofold, the firſt in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:171178:64"/>the fleſh, the ſecond to judg the World, whether do not the Propheſies imply that there muſt be an Harbinger of his ſecond coming as well as of his firſt: for though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Iſai</hi> 40.6. ſeems applicable onely to his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet that <hi>Mal.</hi> 4 5. ſeems to be applicable to both his commings, <hi>I will ſend you</hi> Eliah <hi>the Prophet before the coming of that great and terrible Day of the Lord; and he ſhall turn, or reſtore, the hearts of the fathers to the children,</hi> that is, he ſhall bring the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> to have the ſame heart then holy fathers and progenitor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again it appears from <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.10. the Diſciples upon the Transfiguration asked Chriſt, <hi>Why ſay the Scribes that</hi> Elias <hi>muſt firſt come?</hi> Chriſt anſwers, Elias <hi>truly ſhall firſt come, and ſhall reſtore all things.</hi> Theſe words being ſpoken of Chriſt after <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was beheaded, imply plainly that he is to come again: beſides, how can this reſtoring of all things be verified of the Miniſtry of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> which continued but a ſhort time, and did no ſuch thing as theſe words ſeem to imply? for the reſtoring of all things belongs not to the firſt but to the ſecond coming of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3 19. <hi>Repent and be converted for the blotting out of your ſins, that the times of refreſhing may come from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and that he may ſend Jeſus Chriſt which before was preached unto you, whom the Heavens muſt receive untill the times of the reſtitution of all things.</hi> If the M ſter come not to reſtore all things till then, ſurely his Harbinger who is to prepare his way for reſtoring all things is not to be looked for till then.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:171178:65"/>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Malachy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold I will ſend you</hi> Eliah <hi>the Prophet,</hi> it proves no more that it ſhould be <hi>Eliah</hi> the <hi>This bite</hi> in perſon, than when it is ſaid, David <hi>ſhall rule over you,</hi> proves <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be <hi>David</hi> in perſon. It's like if it be one that comes again it ſhould be <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> himſelf, who was the Harbinger of the firſt coming, ſo that as Chriſt had two comings, ſo his Harbinger ſhould have.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We have Chriſt his Preaching, ſet forth by the place, which was <hi>Galilee, The Word begun from</hi> Galilee, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.37.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galilee</hi> was part of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was divided into two parts, the higher and lower, the higher was for the moſt part the Land of <hi>Nephtali,</hi> wherein ſtood <hi>Capernaum,</hi> the chiefeſt City of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſituate upon the bank of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> over againſt which on the other ſide ſtood <hi>Chorazin:</hi> the lower <hi>Galilee</hi> contained the Tribes of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Iſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char,</hi> wherein were the Cities <hi>Nazareth</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> near the Lake or Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Cana.</hi> Alſo Mount <hi>Iabor</hi> where he was transfigured.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Galilee</hi> was Chriſt's converſation principally when he was upon earth, there it was Chriſt healed the Nobleman's ſon, <hi>John</hi> 4.46.

This was the Town where his Parents dwelt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.39. wherein he had lived thirty years, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.23. hence called <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Prophet of <hi>Nazareth</hi> of <hi>Galilee, Mat.</hi> 21 11. the Reaſon why he could have no honour, there was, becauſe it was his own Countrey. Many Prophets that have their gifts and graces admired in ſtrange places, are (partly from meanneſs of Parentage, and partly from childiſh weakneſs in their childhood acted, partly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:171178:66"/>from obſervation of ſome Infirmities in them, partly from Paſſions to which the holieſt are liable, (Chriſt onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) and partly from curioſity, men being apt to loath Manna becauſe of the commonneſs of it, and partly from wantonneſs, men having itching ears and deſiring change) apt to be contemned by their own People.</p>
               <p>As it ſhould be the care of a faithfull Teacher to keep up the authority of his Miniſtry, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.15. ſo ſhould it be the care of Gods People to honour the Prophets of God, and to eſteem them that are over them in the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12. leſt their Miniſtry become ineffectual; for the Meſſage will never be eſteemed where the perſon is vilified. Chriſt was exceeding contemptuous of the glory and praiſe of men, as appears <hi>John</hi> 7.3, 4. but he knew none could receive good by his Miniſtry that did not eſteem reverently of his perſon: which reverence and honour becauſe he could not have it at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> he goes to <hi>Capernaum.</hi> Teachers ſhould have ſuch ſanctity of life, powerfulneſs and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in Doctrine, ſufficiency of maintenance, as may keep their perſons from contempt, and the People of God ſhould count it their happineſs to have ſuch as they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; for the obtaining ſuch let them ſpare no pains nor coſt.</p>

               <p>Chriſt indeed began his Miniſtry at <hi>Nazareth, Luk.</hi> 4.16. and preached a gracious ſermon to them, and ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth, <hi>v.</hi> 22. but the greateſt part being contemptuous of him, and being inraged from a cloſe application of his doctrine to their conſciences, thought to break his neck, from <hi>v.</hi> 23. to <hi>v.</hi> 31. he went through the midſt of them and came to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> where the people were aſtoniſhed at the powerfulneſs of his doctrine, <hi>v.</hi> 32.</p>

                  <hi>Caſting their nets into the ſea, for they were fiſhers]</hi> The calls of Chriſt uſually meet perſons when they are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their lawful callings.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Chriſt doth not call the learned men of the world, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent Orator, the ſubtile Logician, for to make his own power more manifeſt, whiles he had ſuch weak and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple inſtruments, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Where is the wiſe?

               <p>
                  <hi>And I will make you fiſhers of men]</hi> It's a metaphor, the ſea is the world, the fiſhes, men, the net the Goſpel, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.47. the fiſhers are the preachers.</p>
               <p>Preachers are compared to fiſhers, 1 For their painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; fiſhermen muſt riſe at all hours, and undergo many hard ſtorms, ſo muſt preachers.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For their watchfulneſs, they muſt riſe at all hours, ſo preachers.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For diligence, Fiſhers muſt let down their net at all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:171178:68"/>hours, whether they take ſomething or nothing, ſo muſt preachers.</p>
               <p>Men are like unto Fiſhes, 1 As fiſh ſtands need of ſalt to keep it from putrifaction, ſo do men ſtand need to be ſeaſoned with the Goſpel, and with gracious diſcourſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As fiſhes are begotten of water and live in it,<note place="margin">Rondel. l. de piſe. c. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> and are nouriſhed by it, and die without it; ſo if you be taken by the Goſpel, <hi>You muſt be born of water and the ſpirit, Joh.</hi> 3.5. of the bloud of Chriſt, compared to water, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. and of the ſpirit of Chriſt, without which you can neither live nor be nouriſhed.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As the greater fiſhes devour the leſs, and the great Whale devours all, ſo the great men of the world devour the ſmaller, and the devil devours all, unleſs reſcued by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fiſhes, as ſoon as they perceive the net, ſwim away from it; ſo natural men put away the Goſpel from them, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46.</p>
               <p n="5">5 As fiſhes are not taken unleſs they take the bait, ſo are not ſouls unleſs they receive the glorious things of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p n="6">6 As fiſhes wander in the ſea confuſedly, until they be taken and put into fiſh-ponds; ſo do natural men in the ſea of this world, till they be converted and brought into the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 20. <hi>And they ſtraightway left their nets and followed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The powerful work of Chriſt upon their hearts was ſo great, that they leave their ſhip and nets to follow Chriſt, yea every enjoyment they had, as ſervants, kindred, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. There ſhould nothing be too much for us to leave when Chriſt calls for it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.33. we cannot elſe be Chriſts Diſciples: yea our very lives are to be left for Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.39. <hi>God forbid we ſhould rejoyce in any thing ſave Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.14.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:171178:69"/>
               <p>Moreover, what obedience they performed to Chriſt was ſpeedy and preſent. When God calls we muſt give preſent obedience, ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſacrificing <hi>Iſaac, Exo.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.60. we muſt not conſider the iſſues and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of things, when we have a clear command of God before us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 21. <hi>And going from thence he ſaw other two brethren,</hi> James <hi>the ſon of</hi> Zebedee <hi>and</hi> John <hi>his brother, in a ſhip with</hi> Zebedee <hi>their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have here two called more from their Fiſher-craft to be Chriſts Diſciples, whom he retains a good while with him about the doctrine of the Goſpel; For though men of mean parts and callings may teach, yet not before they have learned themſelves. In that he calls poor Fiſher-men, we may admire the free grace of God, and the greatneſs of his power, who by ſuch weak means could overcome the world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. The treaſure of the Goſpel was in ſuch earthen Veſſels, <hi>That the excellency of the power might be of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 22. <hi>And they ſtraightway left the ſhip, and their father, and followed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may ſee, 1 Their dependance upon the providence of Chriſt, for they did not reaſon, how ſhall we do to live if we leave our callings?</p>
               <p n="2">2 All worldly things muſt be held with a diſpoſition to part with them; when Chriſt calls for them they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left their nets. This beſides the command of God, and example of Saints, ſhould move us, that what we part with for Chriſts ſake, <hi>We ſhall have an hundred fold in this preſent world, and life everlaſting hereafter, Matth.</hi> 19 27.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> 23. <hi>And</hi> Jeſus <hi>went about all</hi> Galilee, <hi>teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Goſpel of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and healing all manner of ſickneſs, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſeaſe among the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have in this laſt part to the end of the Chapter two things, 1 The diligence of Chriſt in preaching and working Miracles. <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The effect hereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Multitudes followed him bringing their ſick unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He went about all</hi> Galilee] Perſons that are not fixt to the overſight of one Church, but have a Call to go into the World, muſt not content themſelves to tarry in any one place. Chriſt went about all <hi>Galilee</hi> preaching in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues. Where the ſeed is caſt among much ground it's probable ſome of it will take root and bring forth fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom]</hi> That is, the glad Meſſage of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the way to attain it. If any man ask how Chriſt could be permitted to preach in the Synagogues; it was partly becauſe grave and godly and knowing men, either known ſo to be, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by others, were ſo permitted to ſpeak: ſo the chief Ruler of the Synagogue permitted <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak unto the People, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.15. <hi>After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto them, ſaying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation to the People, ſay on</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:171178:70"/>
               <p>Beſides, Chriſt confirmed his Doctrine with Miracles, and ſo all men whom malice blinded not might ſee that he was a Teacher come from God, and therefore might eaſily have acceſs into the Synagogue. Now a Synagogue is the ſame with a Convent or Meeting, it is every Aſſembly of men that meet together, whether for judgment or for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, or for holy things. After the word Convent, or Meeting, or Synagogue (for they are all one) came to be transferr'd and brought to thoſe places where theſe Meetings were, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.5. <hi>He hath loved our Nation, and built us a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi> as the word Church in continuance of time came to be transferr'd to the place where the Church met. The Chriſtian Aſſembly is called by the name of Synagogue in the <hi>Greek, James</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p>For the diſtinction betwixt Teaching and Preaching, both which Chriſt uſes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Teaching may have reſpect to the opening prophetical Scriptures, for the ſame <hi>Greek</hi> word is uſed by <hi>Luke,</hi> when Chriſt opened the Propheſie of the ſixty firſt of <hi>Eſay, Luke</hi> 4.15, 16, 17. Preaching is the gathering Doctrines and Obſervations from the Word, with an application of them by reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Exhortation, Inſtruction and Conſolation.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt preached thus in the Synagogues, partly to take advantage of a Concourſe of People, and partly that his Doctrine might come to the teſt, being not preached in a corner, but before judicious Hearers, <hi>John</hi> 18.20. <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid, <hi>I ſpake openly to the World, I ever taught in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue and in the Temple, whither the</hi> Jews <hi>always reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was of theſe Synagogues almoſt in every great City, as at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 15.22. at <hi>Corinth, Acts</hi> 18.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Jews</hi> that traded about Merchandiſe, and out of a zeal to gain Proſelytes ſet up, whom Heathens did not hinder there to profeſs their faith: nor Chriſt diſdain to go into them, though ſome of them had been defiled by
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:171178:70"/>the <hi>Samaritan</hi> mixtures, whoſe Religion was jumbled with ſuperſtitions, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.33. Learn we from Chriſt's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to ſeek for loſt ſouls, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Healing all manner of ſickneſs and all manner of diſeaſe among the people]</hi> By ſickneſs called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he means an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated, rooted diſeaſe; by weakneſs he means want of ſtrength, wearineſs, languiſhing, which are the predictions of a diſeaſe. This diſtinction is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. <hi>Many are weak and ſick among you;</hi> now Chriſt healed all weakneſſes and ſickneſſes,</p>
               <p n="1">1 To gain authority to his Doctrine not heard of before in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To fulfill Propheſies, as <hi>Iſai</hi> 35.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That being healed in their Bodies they might ſeek to him for their Souls.</p>
               <p n="4">4 To prove himſelf to be the Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.2. when <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples ask, <hi>Art thou he that ſhould come, or ſhall we look for another?</hi> Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Go tell</hi> John <hi>what you ſee, the blinde receive their ſight, the lame walk, the Lepers are cleanſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt could have done other Miracles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.4.6.9. but he chuſes ſuch Miracles as were uſefull and beneficial to men, the more to affect them; he heals their diſeaſes and weakneſſes, and this not by Plaiſters and Medicines, after the manner of Phyſicians, but by the Word of his Power, and all this to ſtrengthen our weak faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 24. <hi>And his fame went through all</hi> Syria, <hi>and they brought unto him all ſick People that were taken with divers Diſeaſes and torments, and thoſe which were poſſeſſed with Devils, and thoſe which were lunatick, and that had the Palſey, and he healed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have the effects that followed his Preaching and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, 1 <hi>His fame went through all</hi> Syria, that is, the fame of his Miracles and Doctrine. God makes glory and praiſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:171178:71"/>to accompany worthy and renowned actions, as the ſhadow accompanies the body: let us not then purſue our own glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Through all</hi> Syria] <hi>Syria</hi> lies upon the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> on the Weſt, on the Eaſt bounded by <hi>Euphrates,</hi> on the North bounded by <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> on the South by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they brought unto him all ſick People]</hi> That they might ſee his power extended to all ſorts of Diſeaſes he heals all the ſick, in particular he heals,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Torments, that is, racking Diſeaſes that ſo torment the ſick as if they were upon the Rack, as Malefactors are, to confeſs their wickedneſs and their Confederates.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Poſſeſſed with Devils,</hi> in whom the Devil had ſuch a power to cauſe them to miſchieve themſelves and others.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Lunatick,</hi> theſe were ſuch as the Moon had an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon, eſpecially at the full, at which time they dote, or are mad. The Moon hath an influence over them that have a moiſt and weak Brain, in the new Moon and full Moon it increaſes, and mingles the Humours, to wit, Phlegm and Melancholy, and troubles the Brain, ſo that ſome are carried to dotage, others to madneſs, others to the falling ſickneſs, and with theſe evils the Devil ſometimes gets in, and by ſtirring up the Humours of black and yellow choler, ſorely afflicts the ſick, ſo that ſometimes he drives them to deſpair, ſometimes to murder themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Palſeys.</hi> A Palſey is a Convulſion of the Sinews, that a man that hath it is not able to move.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he healed them]</hi> Without requiring faith of them, for he had not yet ſhewn his power, and many of them coming from far, had little faith in him; afterwards when he had ſhewen many Miracles among them he required faith of the ſick.</p>
               <p n="1">1 We may learn from theſe Multitudes, from the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our wants and weakneſſes to ſeek after Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:171178:71"/>
               <p n="2">2 How great ſoever our Diſeaſes be, to be confident; there is power enough in Chriſt to heal us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 25. <hi>And there followed him great Multitudes of People, from</hi> Galilee, <hi>and from</hi> Decapolis, <hi>and from</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>and from</hi> Judea, <hi>and from beyond</hi> Jordan.</p>
               <p>Here is the laſt effect of Chriſt's healing, to wit, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes followed him. When Chriſt will let forth his power he can make Multitudes follow him. Some followed him for heavenly things, ſome to be healed of their diſeaſes, ſome out of curioſity, ſome out of envy to carp at him. In theſe times, ſome follow Chriſt becauſe of profit, ſome for honor, ſome from examples, ſome for their relations ſake, few out of ſincere love, as reſolving to ſuffer with him, but as ſoon as Chriſt and his Croſs come together they leave him, as the ſtony ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:171178:72"/>Jewiſh teachers; but it ſeems to me that Chriſt added ſome things, not onely by way of explication, but by way of rule; and this he did as the Prophet of his Church, <hi>whom we are to hear in all things, Acts</hi> 3.22.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The place where; it was in the Mount: Thither he went to ſpend the night in prayer, in order to the calling of his twelve Diſciples, for this Sermon, and that <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. was one and the ſame, as appears by their matter and ſubject This Mount is ſuppoſed by Chorographers to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p n="3">3 The occaſion; which was not onely Diſciples, but multitudes were there preſent.

               <p>
                  <hi>He opened his mouth]</hi> That is, Chriſt that had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened the mouths of the Prophets, now opens his own mouth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake unto the Fathers, hath in theſe laſt times ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto us by his Son.</hi>

               <p>But, before I come to open this point, let me lay down ſome cautions, as, 1 That Chriſt ſhews not by what means we may come to bleſſedneſs, but onely the qualifications of them that do attain it, as in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15. in the whole Pſalm; much leſs doth Chriſt ſet down by what merits we obtain bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He ſhews what manner of perſons he will have them to be who expect bleſſedneſs, <hi>viz. poor in ſpirit,</hi> mourners, meek, mercifull, hungring after righteouſneſs; theſe are rather notes of bleſſed men than procuring cauſes of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs. Such we are to put difference betwixt, Scriptures that ſpeak of the cauſes of bleſſedneſs, ſuch as theſe <hi>John</hi> 3.16. 6.54. 8.24. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.1. and thoſe that ſpeak of the properties of bleſſedneſs, ſuch as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1.1. 112.1. <hi>James</hi> 2.1.</p>
               <p>So that we ſee the meaning why Chriſt ſaith not, Bleſſed are they that are redeemed with Bloud, or bleſſed are they which believe in me, becauſe he would teach, not wherefore we are bleſſed, but who they are that are bleſſed.</p>

               <p n="1">1 What ſpiritual poverty is.</p>
               <p>It's whereby a poor ſoul, having ſome grace, ſees a want of further grace, and ſo goes for ſupply out of himſelf to find it in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There are two degrees of it, 1 When we are convinced of our miſerable eſtate by nature, ſo that the ſoul deſires to be otherwiſe then it is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.10.</p>

               </p>

                  <p n="1">1 Elſe we will not come to Chriſt; the prodigal came not to his father till he ſaw himſelf poor.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This is the end of Gods permitting us to fall; God left <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to try him that he might know all that was in his heart, and thereby to humble him for his pride, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. compared with 26. <hi>Peter</hi> after he had fallen to deny Chriſt, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly, Mat.</hi> 27.75.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This is the end why God lays outward poverty on us; that which pride feeds upon is ſome outward thing that the fleſh takes occaſion to ſwell with, now when the fewel is taken away the fire goes out. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was hereby brought to inward poverty; riches are moſtly the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, and hardly can a rich man come to heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.23. <hi>You ſee your calling, brethren, not many mighty,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:171178:74"/>not many noble are called,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. Contrarily, <hi>Hath not God choſen the Poor of this world? Jam.</hi> 2.5. Poor men do uſually more readily believe then rich men, becauſe they are leſs wrapt up in cares and earthly hindrances, hence Chriſt doth with his people as a Phyſician with his Patient that hath a foul body, he purges him almoſt to skin and bone, that having made the body poor, there may be a ſpring of better bloud and ſpirits. Thus providence ſerves to predeſtination, that poverty among other things ſerves to the good of the elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Spiritual Poverty makes us ſucceſſeful in the things of this life.

                  <p n="5">5 Spiritual Poverty is that emptineſs God is wont to fill, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.53, <hi>He filleth the hungry with good things, but the rich he hath ſent empty away,</hi> Such an heart is a ſpiritual emptineſs, ſo that as every thing in nature is filled with ſomething ſo in grace.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 Perſons ſpiritually poor are full of ſence of wants, out of which they mightily pour out their ſouls. You need not dictate words to a man that is ſenſible of wants. A poor Tenant that hath had an hard bargain, can ſufficiently tell his tale to his Landlord. See examples <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.2.102.1, 2. <hi>Job</hi> 29.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In perſons ſo qualified there is a care of uſing and frequenting ordinances. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.6, 7. Poor Perſons go to all places to get riches, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.36. to 42. ſo they that want grace and comfort will attend upon all means; they will go to Gods ordinances. Perſons that think there's too much reading, and hearing, and preaching, were never humbled, why complain they not of the ſun for light, and of the earth for plenty?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Perſons ſpiritually poor are very much in eſteeming any meaſure of grace, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan</hi> eſteems crumbs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.27. A ſoul that ſees the want of grace, and the excellency of it, is thankful for every good motion. A Chriſtian knowing he deſerves nothing, is thankful for every thing, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Perſons ſpiritually poor are fearful to offend God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the dependances of their grace, comfort and glory is upon God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13.

                  <p n="5">5 Such perſons are teachable; you may lead a man poor in ſpirit with any Counſel, having ſmarted for ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?

                  <p n="6">6 Such perſons are not wont to upbraid others with
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:171178:75"/>their conditions, they are ſo taken up with their own, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.16, 17. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 30.

                  <p n="3">3. It's conſolation to perſons who have afflicted eſtates in this world; there's a day coming when comfort ſhall come, provided that with mourning for thy miſeries thou ſpecially mourns for thy ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.25. <hi>Now he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and thou art tormented.</hi> Though thy comfort come not yet, yet in Gods time it ſhall come. They are not bleſſed who mourn for the loſs of their wealth, or death of their friends, but they who mourn for offending God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 In all our confeſſions and profeſſed humiliations, ſee that you do not declare them onely hiſtorically, but mourn for them. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 38.17. <hi>I will declare mine iniquities, and will be ſory for my ſin.</hi> When thou prayes, let thy heart mourn in prayer, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 55.2.

                  <p n="2">2 Univerſal. That King that was ſory for his conſent to <hi>Daniels</hi> death, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.14, was not ſory for his denial of the truth, in refuſing to venture all in a good cauſe. <hi>Herod</hi>

                  <p n="3">3 After converſion as well as before. It's a vain opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to think we need not ſorrow after converſion, and that a Chriſtians ſtate is altogether a ſtate of joy. Joy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may ſtand together in the ſoul, but not about one and the ſame object; joy in God, and ſorrow for ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Let thy mourning be, not onely in regard of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of ſin, but principally in regard of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety thereof to the nature of God, and to the nature of him that loves thee, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.38, compared with <hi>v.</hi> 48. <hi>Mary</hi> having a ſenſe of Gods love weeps bitterly, and waſhes Chriſts feet with her tears.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Let it be joyned with faith. Firſt Chriſt looks upon the ſoul, and gives ſome teſtimony of his love to it, and then the ſoul looks on Chriſt with a ſad heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.75. Chriſt firſt lookt on <hi>Peter,</hi> then he went out and wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly. Its the nature of faith to apply the wounds and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of Chriſt unto it ſelf, <hi>Eſa</hi> 53.5. thence follows mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 This mourning for ſin is the greateſt; hence reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to the mourning for an onely ſon when dead, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.11. to the drawing of water, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6, as if it had been in buckets. The ground whereof is, becauſe they apprehend ſin as the greateſt of evils: 1 Becauſe it is the cauſe of all evils, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It keeps off the greateſt good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It cannot be purged away but with the greateſt price, even Chriſts bloud.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 There's more evil in ſin then in any thing: hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, 1 A reſolution not to meddle with ſin, as <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> when he had ſmarted by joyning with <hi>Ahab</hi> in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out a fleet, he would not joyn with his ſon <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> though ſollicited.

                  <head>Tryals of thy Mourning.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 True mourning that comes from the ſpirit of grace, looks at God who hath been diſhonoured, and at Chriſt who hath been crucified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3, 4. <hi>Mine iniquitie is ever before me; againſt thee, thee onely, have I ſinned.</hi> Hoſ. 6.1. <hi>Come let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn us and he will heal us. Luke</hi> 15.18. <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee:</hi> ſo it looks on Chriſt as crucified, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In oppoſition to this, there is a mourning flowing from the ſpirit of bondage, which is a forced work; this differs from the other, as the motion of a clock, from the motion of a living creature: the one is moved from a principle of life, the other from weights; in the one a man is humbled, in the other he humbles himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 True mourning hath a change of heart going with it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.38. thoſe eys that had been employd in wanton glancings now they weep; thoſe hairs that had been laid out to entangle now wipes Chriſts feet; thoſe lips that had kiſt wantonly now kiſs Chriſts feet. Hypocritical mourners have no change of heart, they are like thievs who forbear ſtealing while in priſon onely.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If thy mourning for ſin be right, outward contents will not take it off. <hi>David</hi> had the delights of a Court, yet did not this take off his mourning, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.3.38.6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 If thy mourning for ſin be right, it will be on this ground, becauſe it turnes away the face of God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Thou wilt mourn for ſecret ſins as well as for open, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.12. <hi>Cleanſe me from my ſecret ſins,</hi> as vain thoughts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Thou wilt mourn eſpecially for thy great ſins, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> doth for his adultery and murder, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51, 14. and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:171178:78"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> for his blaſphemy, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1.13.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Thy mourning will be eſpecially for thy maſter ſin, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32.4, 5. All <hi>Davids</hi> mourning was nothing, till he came to touch upon this ſin of murder, to mourn for it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Thou wilt mourn for it, not onely in times of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 9.27. and <hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 27.4. but likewiſe in times of proſperity.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 True mourning looks at Gods face and favour, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.8, 12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.16. Hypocrites mourning is to have temporal judgements removed, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27. and ſo <hi>Jehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.29, 30. and thoſe who howled upon their beds for Corn and Wine, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe Chriſt pronounces them bleſſed, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 149.4. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in his people, he will beautifie the meek with ſalvation. Pſalm</hi> 147.6. <hi>The Lord lifts up the meek. The meek ſhall increaſe their joy in the Lord, Iſai</hi> 29.19.</p>

                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe the ſoul ſees better meat and drink then it ſaw before. So that as when we are at a feaſt, and ſee a freedom to partake of better meat and drink, our hunger and thirſt is taken off, from that which is more courſe to that which is more delicate and pleaſant; ſo the ſoul ſeeing Chriſt and holineſs to be meat that endures to everlaſting life, and all things here but periſhing food, the hunger and thirſt to the one eates out the hunger and thirſt to the other, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27.</p>

                  <p>Now, when our deſires, and hungrings and longings are for righteouſneſs, it argues a principle of renovation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. <hi>I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt, q. d.</hi> when once a man comes to Chriſt he doth not hunger and thirſt as formerly he did.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It's a bleſſed thing to be made like Chriſt; but in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:171178:82"/>hungring after righteouſneſs we are made like to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.32. <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence Chriſt preferred the doing the will of God before his food, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.20. ſo <hi>Job</hi> 23.12. <hi>I eſteemed the words of his mouth more then my neceſſary food.</hi>

There is no man righteous on earth that doth good and ſinneth not, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Purity of heart is taken <hi>Evangelically.</hi> To be pure is to be full of it ſelf, and not to have any other thing ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it; ſo purity of heart is that which doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſin to mingle with the frame and purpoſe of the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:171178:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>heart, but the heart ſtill caſts it out of it ſelf, it reſiſts and rejects it.</p>
                  <p>As a thing is ſaid to be pure though it may have ſome droſs cleaving to it, as it's pure gold when its digged out of the Mineral, though there be much droſs in it, and we ſay it's pure ayr, though for a time there be many fogs and miſts within it, and it's pure water, though there may be ſome mud at the bottome, a man may be ſaid to have a pure heart, though there be a cleaving of much droſs to it.</p>
                  <p>Holy men have a fountain of original corruption in them, and from this fountain ſins ariſe continually, as the ſcum in the pot; but as in wine, or honey, or water, though the ſcum ariſe yet ſtill it purifieth it ſelf, and caſts it out; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily in men of impure hearts the ſcum ariſeth but it ſeeths in, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24 12. <hi>She wearied her ſelf with lies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and her great ſcum went not out of her, q. d.</hi> Holy men have their ſcum ariſing in their hearts, as well as wicked, but here is the difference, wicked mens ſcum ſeeths in, and mingles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but men of pure heart have a cleanſing and purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſition, that caſts out what ever evil comes, though it be continually riſing; though he be many times mired he ſtill waſheth himſelf again, he cannot endure it, he doth not as the ſwine delight in it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>That which comes from within defiles the man;</hi> the meaning is, when ſin ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in a man from day to day, if he cheriſh ſin and entertain it, and ſuffer it to dwell and abide in his heart quietly, without diſturbance, if he ſuffer it (as it were) to be ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in, now they defile the heart; but if ſins ariſe in the heart, and he continually reſiſt them, and caſts them forth, and purifieth himſelf from them, ſuch a man is not defiled with them, nor is his his mind defiled nor conſcience defiled: but notwithſtanding this boiling out of evil he is a man of a pure heart: yet may ſin cleave to a man as droſs doth to the ſilver, but it mingles not with the regenerate part, nor that mingles not with it, no more then oyl and water

                  <p n="2">2 The beholding of God in his word. By this was Chriſt ſet forth evidently crucified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. The word enlightens the eys, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.8. In the glaſs of the word we behold God with open face, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. which ſets him forth, 1 By removing all imperfections from him. 2 By aſcribing all perfections to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The beholding of God in the light of his countenance <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. I ſhall behold thy face in righteouſneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 13.16. <hi>An hypocrite ſhall not come before him,</hi> that is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the light of his face, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140. <hi>ult. the upright ſhall dwell in his preſence.</hi> The beholding of this is the earneſt deſire of every holy man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7. If there be ſo much comfort in this when we behold it here, what will there be in future bleſſedneſs?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In the life to come we behold God. This beholding is an eternal fulneſs of joy, 1 Its a fulneſs of joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.

                  <p n="2">2 Its eternal. If a man were to leave heaven after a thouſand years it were not happineſs, but we ſhall for ever enjoy this happineſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.18.

                  <p n="2">2 Freedome from temptations, eſpecially thoſe of Satan which often make the life comfortleſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 From labours, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3. The dead in the Lord reſt from their labour. They have the reſt of an eternal ſabbath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.10. <hi>All things reſt when they come at their proper place;</hi> this is a maxime among men, but true of glorified perſons.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 From ſociety of wicked men. <hi>The Egyptians whom you have ſeen you ſhall ſee them no more for ever, Exod.</hi> 15.13. ſhall then be made true, all that do iniquity ſhall be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. and turned into hell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 From all neceſſities of nature. We ſhall need no houſe to dwel in, no fire to warm us, no meat to feed us, no Phyſick to cleanſe us, for our bodies ſhall be ſpiritual, not needing any of theſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 43.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 From all ſorrow and mourning, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This joy conſiſteth in the enjoyment of all goods, as</p>

                  <p n="4">4 Perfect knowledge of God.

                  <p n="6">6 Joy. The joy of the holy Ghoſt is onely the earneſt hereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. The joy of the holy Ghoſt exceeds the joyes of the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. the joy of heaven exceeds the joy of the holy Ghoſt, as the whole bargain doth the earneſt; but the joy and glory of heaven which Saints ſhall have at the laſt judgment or manifeſtation of Gods ſons, ſhall exceed what they have now; hence they grone for the adoption of their bodies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted till their fellowes come to them ſhall not be made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.40. when the whole number of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhall come together there ſhall be a new treaſure of glory broken up, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10. He ſhall come to be glorified of his Saints, and to be admired of all them that believe: now their admiration muſt needs ariſe from ſome new glory they had not ſeen before: in that day heaven it ſelf ſhall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there ſhall not be onely a drop, the whole God-head ſhall manifeſt himſelf, there we ſhall rejoyce at this voice, I am <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This joy is demonſtrated; 1 From the object: the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of God alone (though there were neither Saint nor Angel) makes us happy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things,</hi> How? <hi>I will be his God;</hi> he hath all things that hath him that hath all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. God ſhall be all in all, you need not in glory to ſtep to any creature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The ſubject of this joy, is the general aſſembly of the firſt born whoſe names are writ in heaven. <hi>The righteous ſhall ſhine as the Sun, Matth.</hi> 13.43. ſo that as a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter powred into a veſſel of wine loſes both taſte and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and becomes wine: or as Iron put into the fire, doth after a ſort take the nature of fire; or as the air inlightned with the ſun ſeems not ſo much to be inlightned as to be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:171178:90"/>light it ſelf; ſo ſhall we in the future glory be transformed that we ſhall not ſo ſeem to be glorified, as glory it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>So far as this preſent World ſurmounts that Life we lived in our Mothers Womb, ſo far doth the Life in Glory ſurmount this preſent Life. When we were in our Mothers Womb we could not have imagined that we were to come into ſuch a ſpacious World, ſo full of glorious Objects, why ſhould we then doubt of the glory of that future ſtate?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The propriety of this glory and joy: it's not barely the beholding of glory that makes us happy, for ſome think the Goats ſhall behold the happineſs of the Sheep at the laſt, to increaſe their miſery. Therefore all this glory ſhall be yours, <hi>John</hi> 17.22, <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt me I have given them. Epheſ:</hi> 1.19, there's a <hi>Riches of Glory</hi> in the Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> For Application, let it provoke us to holineſs and purity. <hi>Heb:</hi> 12.14, <hi>Follow holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord. Pſalm</hi> 17.15, <hi>I ſhall behold thy face in righteouſneſs, I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, q: d:</hi> when mine Enemies abound with earthly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and delights, and leave their treaſure to their children, I ſhall be ſatisfied with the beholding of thee, I ſhall appear before thee in righteouſneſs, that is, in the righteouſneſs of my cauſe. Of which <hi>v:</hi> 1, and when I awake out of theſe preſent troubles, and at the Reſurrection, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs; that is, if there were neither Saint nor Angel thou wouldſt fully ſatisfie me.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> like a ſtout Runner preſt towards the Mark of Holineſs for the Prize of Glory, as he that runs in a Race runs towards the Goal for the Prize, <hi>Phil:</hi> 3.13, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 9.25, 26, Where God means to beſtow Heaven he firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows heavenly qualities. If Heaven vomited out unholy Angels, or at leaſt they left it of their own accords, <hi>Jude</hi> 6, then will it not receive profane perſons. <hi>Without are Dogs,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:171178:91"/>Revel:</hi> 22.15, and thereinto entereth nothing that defileth nor that worketh abomination.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Exhortation to holy perſons to long for this ſight of God. We ſhall ſee him not <hi>quantus, ſed qualis eſt,</hi> not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his greatneſs but according to his glory, 1. <hi>John</hi> 3.2, We ſhall ſee him as he is. We ſhall not ſee God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely in himſelf, but comprehenſively, ſo far as we ſhall be able to comprehend, as Bottles caſt into the Sea cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the whole Sea, but onely according to their capacity. This was <hi>Job</hi>'s comfort when his Reins were conſuming within him, yet that he ſhould ſee God, <hi>Job.</hi> 19.25,</p>
                  <p>If in this World we take ſuch delight in the beholding of beautiful Creatures, as Sun, Moon, Stars, Medows, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Rivers, Children, Pearls, what delight ſhall we take in the beholding of God? the beholding of whom ſhall dim all other Beauties, as the Light of the Sun doth the Light of a Candle.</p>
                  <p>But wofull will wicked men be who ſhall be ſevered from the bleſſed preſence and face of God, 2 <hi>Theſſ:</hi> 1.9, It was the aggravation of <hi>Haman</hi>'s miſery that he had his face covered that he might not ſee the King, <hi>Heſter</hi> 7.8, much more wofull will the caſe of wicked men be, after they have received their Sentence, they ſhall never ſee the Kings face more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But God is inviſible, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, <hi>Whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 6.16, <hi>John</hi> 1.18, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this preſent life <hi>no man can ſee Gods face and live, Exod:</hi> 33.20, We cannot ſee God with bodily eys in this life, becauſe the act of ſeeing preſuppoſes a viſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but in God there is neither bodily light, colour, nor figure. Beſides, the Father never took any viſible ſhape up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> the Son was wont to appear by aſſuming ſome Creature upon him, and the Holy Ghoſt appeared in the ſhape of a Dove, and of fiery Tongues,

Exod:</hi> 23.9, 10, 11, <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moſes, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and ſeventy of the Elders went up into the Mount and ſaw the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and there was under his feet a paved work of a Saphire-ſtone, and the body of Heaven, as it were, in his brightneſs.

This ſhadow or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance the Nobles and Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaw, yet upon them laid he not his hand, nor ſlew them, for they ate and drank delighting in the glorious reſemblance they ſaw: the common people did not ſee God in this ſhape for fear they ſhould make an Idol, or Image of him; but the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Elders, becauſe they were wiſe men and men fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God they ſaw this ſhadow or ſight: this is mentioned in oppoſition to that common fear, <hi>Judges</hi> 13.22, <hi>Manoah</hi> ſaith to his Wife, <hi>We ſhall ſurely die becauſe we have ſeen God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object. Moſes</hi> ſaw Gods back parts, <hi>Exod:</hi> 33.18, 20, compared with 22, 23, having deſired to ſee Gods glory, <hi>v.</hi> 18,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee the divine eſſence, not in it ſelf but in ſome ſhape, or figure, that ſo he ſeeing the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous majeſty of God might declare it to the people. He heard the voice of God and he would fain ſee the form of him that ſpoke to him, (as appears by Gods anſwer, <hi>Thou canſt not ſee my face, for no man can ſee my face and live, v.</hi> 20,) but God anſwers, Thou canſt not ſee it; for this
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:171178:92"/>ſhining of my face though it be bodily and aſſumed, yet becauſe in ſome reſpect it ſhadows out the brightneſs of my eſſence and majeſty, hence it is ſo great that no mortal eye can behold it, but he would be dazzled and blinded with the ſhining thereof, but there's an hollow Rock in <hi>Sinah,</hi> get thee in there, and I will cover thee with a Cloud till my glorious Face paſs by, and then I will take away the Cloud that thou maiſt ſee my back parts, like the hinder part of the Train of a Prince, when he is paſt by, ſo that the light there was ſo tempered that <hi>Moſes</hi> could behold it, and was greatly refreſhed with it.</p>

Becauſe this peaceable diſpoſition whereby we are thus peaceably affected, flows from that peace perſons have inwardly in their own hearts; for as you ſee impure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are very unpeaceable, as devils and wicked men, <hi>Rom:</hi> 3.17, ſo holy men are very peaceable, as being the fruit of Chriſt's atonement, <hi>Epheſ,</hi> 2.13, <hi>Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, good will towards men, Luke</hi> 2.14, <hi>q: d:</hi> This was one fruit of Chriſt's Death, to ſtabliſh peace among men.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 Mortifie your luſts, <hi>James</hi> 4.1. <hi>Whence come wars, come they not of your luſts?</hi> The ſea would be calm were it not for ſtrong windes, ſo would your hearts were it not for your luſts; now the ſins to be mortified are, 1 pride, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. 2 tale-bearing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.20, 21. 3 unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.27. 4 provoking ſpeeches, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.26. 5 immoderate meditation of wrongs we have ſuffered. 6 hatred, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.12. 7 forcing of wrath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.33. 8 Let every one do his duty in that kinde of life to which God hath called him, let him not lift up himſelf above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor reprehend the works of others and praiſe his own as better, but let one ſerve another by love. <hi>Luth. Tom.</hi> 4.167. 9 Practice Chriſtian moderation in remitting of your right for peace ſake, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. the word is <hi>epieikeia,</hi> which ſignifies a yielding of our right.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Study peace, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.11. The Apoſtle bids the Theſſalonians <hi>to ſtudy to be quiet.</hi> We ſtudy books, arts, ſciences, but this is an excellent ſtudy. Sit down and think this man and I are at ods, how ſhould I make up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? This is the purſuing of peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.14. <hi>Seek peace and purſue it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Practice Chriſtian kindneſs, as giving, lending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One end why God gives us the things of this life, is that we may maintain peace with them. <hi>Every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts, Prov.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Jacob</hi> took off a malice of twenty years ſtanding by a gift. Gifts are compared to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:171178:94"/>precious ſtones, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.8. ſo that as perſons that wear precious ſtones do oft delight to look upon them, ſo do ſuch perſons look upon gifts. Alſo mutual entertainments, mutual viſitings, mutual counſellings and comfortings.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Where you are damnified put up ſmall wrongs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.26, 27. though Chriſt were free from paying tribute, yet that he might not offend, he bids <hi>Peter</hi> pay a piece of money for tribute.</p>
                  <p>Where you have damnified others, give ſatisfaction for the leaſt wrong, <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 31.39. for peace ſake gave ſatisfaction to <hi>Laban</hi> for that which was torn of beaſts, or ſtoln by day and night.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In caſe of offence with any man, proffer reconciliation both in your ſpeeches and cariages. Imitate the Lord, who, though the perſon offended, yet ſought to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. As when an houſe is on fire every man brings water to quench it, ſo let us meet one another in the midſt to quench the fire of contention, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.58. <hi>Agree with thine adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary whiles thou art in the way with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 Beware of ſtigmatizing one another with nick names; take heed leſt ye put off the name of Chriſt from thoſe that have put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal</hi> 3.28. by calling them Puritans, Sectaries, Anabaptiſts. If every natural body no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire its own unity then its being, why ſhould not the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body in like manner?</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Get the peace of Chriſt to rule in your hearts, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. Creatures of a meek and peaceable nature, though you uſe them never ſo harſhly, yet are they peaceable, becauſe they have principles of meekneſs and patience in them, whereas creatures of fierce natures, as Lions and Wolves, though you uſe them never ſo gently yet will they be fierce, becauſe they have ſuch principles: ſo wicked men have not known the way of peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.17. but godly men uſually are of peaceable ſpirits, becauſe the peace of God rules in their hearts.</p>

                  <head>Motives to Peace.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 Peace is a bleſſing that comprehends all bleſſings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 29.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>The Lord will give his people the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of peace.</hi> What is our joy but the peace of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? What is our health but the peace of our humours? If a man were in heaven and could not have it in peace, it would not be comfortable. Everlaſting peace is part of our joy in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That which is the excellenteſt life every one deſires to live. Such is a life of peace, not onely in that the moſt flouriſhing Commonwealths have lived it, but God and Angels: that which is the worſt life devils and wicked men live, ſuch is a lite of contention. Hence Chriſt the Prince of peace lived this life; called <hi>the Prince of Peace, Eſai</hi> 9.6. gave it for a legacy to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 14.27. <hi>Eſai</hi> 11.6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The univerſal peace that is among all creatures. The heavenly bodies, Sun, Moon and Stars keep their courſe; the Sea keepeth within the girdle of the Sands and doth not invade the earth; the Windes blow not together but ſucceſſively; the contrary qualities in the world, heat and cold, drought and moiſture, are ſo tempered together, that like muſical diſcords they make a perfect harmony: Woods of trees, fields of corn, grow without moleſting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, creatures not onely of the ſame kinde but of different kinde feed peaceably one by another. If peace be among all bodies, let it be much more among the myſtical body of Chriſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 133.1. <hi>How good a thing is it for brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 The common enemy ſhould ſet us at peace; I mean the Popiſh and Prelatical combinations. So that the queſtion is not ſo much, what kinde of government we ſhall have in Proteſtant Churches, but whether we ſhall have any Proteſtant Church at all? At the Battle of <hi>Lepanto</hi> when there was great differences and animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:171178:95"/>betwixt the three generals, <hi>Don John</hi> and <hi>Venereus</hi> and the third general, yet when the battel came to be fought they united againſt the Turk and got a mighty victory againſt his navy, the like whereof hath hardly been heard of. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Jude</hi> 3. contend for the common ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Herein conſiſts the form of charity, not in this, that we are all of one minde, for that is kept for heaven, but that we are peaceably affected in our hearts, and wiſh well one to another. When <hi>Luther</hi> had vented ſome hard ſpeeches againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſayes he, though <hi>Luther</hi> count me a dogge, yea a devil, yet I'le count him a famous ſervant of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The ſmalneſs of matters which cauſes a breach of peace: many are as angry for rejecting their opinions as <hi>Jonah</hi> was for his gourd. I know the ſmalleſt thing in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ought to be made conſcience of, yet thoſe points without the knowledge whereof many have come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though they may obſtruct publick communion, yet know I no cauſe why they ſhould hinder peace and private communion among thoſe that fear God. Learn we of the Romiſh Churches (if it be expedient and lawful ſo to call them) among which there are controverſies of far more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> of the infallible judge in all points, of the Chriſtian faith; the Spaniſh and Italian Churches defend the Pope to be the ſupreme judge, affirming him ſo to be inſpired with the ſpirit of truth that in all his decrees and determinations he cannot erre, on the other ſide the French cry him out of his infallible chair, and conclude him ſubject to errour, and depoſable by a general counſel; yet in this brawling there's no univerſal breaking of communion, why then ſhould not private communion be granted among thoſe that fear God?</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The multiplicity of relations that tyes Chriſtians to peace, worſhip of the ſame God, profeſſion of the ſame faith, expectation of the ſame hope, ſuffering for the ſame cauſe, begotten by the ſame word, children of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:171178:95"/>ſame father, have the ſame comfort of love, the ſame fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Spirit. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The benefits that come by it, 1 The kingdome of God conſiſts in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. Some Chriſtians thought that others could not come to heaven if they did not eat ſuch meats as they, but <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, <hi>The kingdome of God conſiſts not in meat and drink, but in righteouſneſs and peace, and joy of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2 It's the way to a long and an happy life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. 3 <hi>The fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace, Jam.</hi> 3.21. <hi>q. d</hi> the crop of grace and glory is not reap'd of proud and contentious perſons, of ſuch as make rents in Churches, and would be many maſters, of which he ſpeaks, <hi>v.</hi> 1. nor of thoſe who boaſting of themſelves and their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions would alone ſeem to be wiſe; but it will be reap'd of peaceable Chriſtians, who being of a peaceable ſpirit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves endeavour to make peace among others, and ſow the ſeed of peaceable diſcourſes in order thereto.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 By peace we reſemble God, for when in God there are three ſubſiſtences, yet there is one will, one love, and one conſent, whereas in contention wereſemble the <hi>Babel</hi> builders.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Peace is the way to have the preſence of God with us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Live in peace and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</hi> Some creatures are by artificial means invited, as Pigeons by looking glaſſes, and Larkes by the reſemblance of the Sun in a looking glaſs, by peace the God of peace is invited, who unites thoſe one to another that are united to him, <hi>John</hi> 17.21.</p>
                  <p>Ile conclude with <hi>Bernards</hi> Diſtich <hi>Nullum turbavi, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes pacificavi: Laeſus ſuſtinui, nec mihi complacui.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 The peaceable carriage of you to others will cauſe others to carry peaceably to you, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Gideon</hi> peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably anſwering the men of <hi>Ephraim</hi> (who did unjuſtly in proud wrath chide him) their ſpirits abated towards him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For they ſhall be called the children of God]</hi> that is, they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:171178:96"/>who evidence their Chriſtianity (out of conſcience of the command) by ſtabliſhing peace among them with whom they live, are and ought to be acknowledged among men as regenerate, and thereupon called Gods children: 1 They are his children in likeneſs; as God ſent his Son into the world to make peace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. ſo do they. 2 They are like Chriſt, who being God and man made peace with the blood of his croſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. and took away all enmity betwixt God and us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They ſhall be called the children of God in heaven, though ſometimes in this world they are not ſeen nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 They ſhall be ſo called, becauſe having firſt made peace with God, they, feeling the ſweetneſs of it, make peace with men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But how can ſuch as make peace with men be called Gods children, ſeeing we find many carnal men good arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators and make-peaces among neighbours?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 Such perſons do it not out of conſcience of the command, but either out of vain glory, or to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves imployed in buſineſs, and ſo to keep off their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, or at moſt out of a principle of good neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, whereas Gods children do it from the command.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They make peace, not out of the ſence of inward peace they have with God, but out of the beneficial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of neighbourly peace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Carnal men making peace, it's uſual in matters of claim betwixt man in <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> but peace-makers to whom the promiſe belongs make peace where there are heart boylings, and ſiniſter conceptions, and heart grudges betwixt man and man</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Carnal peace makers are ſtir'd up to do what they do upon ſollicitations, and intreaties; but thoſe to whom the promiſe is made, are ſtirred up to their duty by the belief of the promiſe, and it is done many times in ſecret where no
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:171178:96"/>man knows what they aime at, but themſelves know that they aime at a right underſtanding betwixt neighbour and neighbour, Chriſtian and Chriſtian in order to peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Exhort to peace-making, that this promiſe may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to you, as God is called <hi>the God of peace, Rom.</hi> 16.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 33.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. So by endeavouring after peace you ſhall be like unto him.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> 3 things, 1 The ſuffering, its perſecution. 2 The cauſe, not for wickedneſs, but for righteouſneſs ſake. 3 The crown, theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is meant by righteouſneſs?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither univerſal or paticular morral righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for many of the heathens ſuffered for honeſt intereſts, and for righteous cauſes, but ſpiritual righteouſneſs is here meant, as for the profeſſion of their faith, for conſcience towards God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>This is thank worthy, if a man for conſcience towards God ſuffer wrongfully and endure grief:</hi> So that righteouſneſs ſignifies obedience to all the commands of God. Here is inrightment to bleſſedneſs, when we will rather ſuffer then tranſgreſs the commandment of God.</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> They that are perſecuted for Chriſt, and his cauſe and commandements, are bleſſed perſons. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried he ſhall receive the crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Application. 1 Be exhorted to ſuffer perſecution,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For Chriſt's ſake, 1 Hereby thou wilt prove thy ſoundneſs of heart, <hi>Dan:</hi> 3.17, 18, <hi>Shadrach, Meſhech</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> and <hi>Daniel cap.</hi> 6, ſhewed their ſincerity herein: unſound men will not ſuffer Perſecution, <hi>Gal:</hi> 6.12, The denying of Circumciſion was the Object of Perſecution, hence the falſe Teachers would have the <hi>Galatians</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed leſt they ſhould ſuffer Perſecution, <hi>Matth:</hi> 13.21.

                  <p n="6">6 A great deal of good comes to Chriſtians by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſecution. 1 Hereby affections come to be looſened from the World, and to be faſtened upon God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 142.4, 5,</p>

Holy example is a duty we ow to the whole world, and as by holy examples perſons are built up towards Heaven, ſo by wicked words and works, yea by indifferent things done unſeaſonably, perſons are
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:171178:106"/>made worſe, and built up towards deſtruction. <hi>Lev,</hi> 19.14, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lay a ſtumbling block before the blinde.</hi> Scandals are as Pits and Snares to catch living creatures, wherein the unwary and blinde are taken.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 Nothing ſo darkens the glory of the Church, as the ſpots and unſavoury Life of thoſe that pretend to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. What hath kept people from joyning to us? Was it Priſons, Baniſhment, hazards? Perhaps ſo in ſome, but
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:171178:106"/>that which in likelihood hath hindered many, hath been our not walking up to our Profeſſion. Fire and Fagot though it may ſcare ſome, yet it cannot make them think in their conſciences ſuch and ſuch Tenents to be Errours, but ſcandalous practices of headineſs, pride and paſſion: worldly mindedneſs makes them think in their conſciences we are in an errour, and ſo may in time hearten them to perſecute us. Moreover, hereby blurs and reproaches are caſt upon the Church. If it be ſo great an offence to bring a ſcandal on one <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> that he that did it was amerced in an hundred Shekels of Silver for bringing up an evil name upon a Virgin in <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 22.19. then what ſhall be done to them that bring a Reproach upon all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the word <hi>deſtroy</hi> is taken for <hi>oppoſe,</hi> appears by <hi>v.</hi> 19. where doing and teaching is oppoſed to breaking, or rather to oppoſing.</p>
                  <p>And therefore whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> cry out againſt the Apoſtles, as going againſt the Profeſſion of their Maſter, know, the Apoſtles would have never mentioned theſe words of Chriſt if their Doctrine had differed from his; we cannot think that thoſe grave men that were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the defence of their Doctrine, not onely not to have written things contrary one to another, but things contrary to themſelves, therefore we muſt inquire how their ſayings may agree. Hence know there's a twofold Law,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Natural, which is everlaſting and common to all, this is right reaſon. This makes men good out of love of virtue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Civil, this looks onely to outward innocency, and doth not look to the minde, as the Law of Nature doth. This is peculiar to every Nation, and changeable; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains men from evil for fear of puniſhment; <hi>Becauſe of tranſgreſsions the Law was added, Gal.</hi> 3.19. that is, the Law written in Tables was added to that Law writ in the heart, ſo that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had certain things brought from the Law of Nature, and certain things proper to that People, and applied to thoſe Times. <hi>Juſtin</hi> againſt <hi>Triph.</hi> ſaith, ſome things are univerſally and by nature everlaſting goods, which they that performed had common praiſe with Chriſtians.</p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:171178:111"/>
                  <p>But ſome things were added becauſe of the Peoples hardneſs of heart, (and by reaſon of occaſions of Times and places may be added) therefore as before the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was given, true Faith working by Love was that which God lookt after, ſo in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> God would have himſelf loved with all the heart, would have the heart circumciſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all this was properly tranſlated from the Law of Nature, and was not properly a part of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law, but the ſcope and mark at which the Civil Law aimed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to fulfill the Law]</hi> So that the ſcope of the Law was to make men good, as by the fear of God, and love of God, and love of one another, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.38, 39, 40. theſe are called the greateſt Commands on which depends the Law and the Prophets. So loving of our Neighbour is <hi>the fulfilling of the Law, Rom.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14. and <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>If ye fulfill the royal Law according to the Scriptures, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, ye ſhall do well;</hi> this fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Law according to the Scripture, he means the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that which was commanded by the Law was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by few, but Chriſt hath enabled his People under the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to perform, writing his Laws in their hearts by his Spirit. Therefore we ſee how Chriſt fulfilled the Law; that which was chief and unchangeable in it, I mean the Law of Nature, Chriſt eſtabliſhed it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it.</p>
                  <p>But that which was civil and poſitive, part whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Jewiſh worſhip, and part concerned civil ſociety or the government of the common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though it came to an end at the death of Chriſt, ſo far as it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned worſhip, and came to an end at the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſo far as it concerned civil ſociety, yet did not Chriſt oppoſe theſe laws, neither by his example nor by his doctrine, he did not oppoſe the Church laws but obſerved
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:171178:112"/>them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8, 4. <hi>Shew thy ſelf to the prieſt and offer the gift that</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded:</hi> alſo Chriſt kept the Paſſeover, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.18. Till himſelf had put an end to them by his death, to keep the Jews from going a whoring to ſtrange worſhips, and to ſever them from other nations, God gave them the ceremonial law, but when the time came the Jews and Gentiles ſhould be embodied in one worſhip, the other worſhip vaniſhed, as laws of war do when peace comes to take place, therefore Chriſt did nothing againſt the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law, as he doth nothing againſt the laws belonging to the time of war, that when the war is ended ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim peace, or as the ſhadow vaniſhed when the body comes, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Which are the ſhadow of things to come but the body is Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 10.1.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this law was fulfilled of Chriſt, 1 Becauſe he obeyed it, and commanded others to obey it as long as the law giver would have it in force, 2 Becauſe by his ſacrifice he put an end to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For the laws of nature or naturals, Chriſt fulfil'd them explaining them more clearly then ever they were explained, ſtrengthening them by more exact commands, hence the law of Chriſt is called the perfect law of liberty, <hi>James</hi> 1.25. <hi>Ireneus l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 27. the Lord diſſolved not the naturals of the law, but extended them, and fulfilled them, as a veſſel that had ſome water before, but is now filled up to the brim:</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Chriſt fulfilled the ceremonial law by giving himſelf typified therein: not by taking off the bond of the law, but by withdrawing the cauſe for which that law was given and did continue: this law was called carnal or fleſhly, for the rites of fleſhly ſacrifices beheld therein: beſides Chriſt fulfilled the law of nature, as a picture that is firſt drawn rudely, but after the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ainter comes to draw it to the life, ſo the law of nature was ſet down more imperfectly, now more perfectly.</p>
                  <p>Beſides Chriſt fulfilled the law and Prophets, by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:171178:112"/>the propheſies that went of himſelf, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 66.1, 2. <hi>Ezek,</hi> 36.25, 26. <hi>Zach,</hi> 12.10.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then that whereas the Phariſees ſlandred Chriſt and his doctrine, that he was an apoſtate, and an enemy to the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> which God had writ in tables of ſtone, and that he brought a doctrine to the law overturning all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and whereas carnal men had an opinion that now under the new Teſtament they were free from the bonds of the ten Commandements, and ſo from all puniſhment, and therefore they were privileged to ſwear and be drunk, and what not? which poſition was alſo gathered by wicked perſons from the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28.6.1, 2. Chriſt therefore ſpeaking to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples that they might not be bewitched with either of theſe opinions, ſaith, <hi>Thinke not that I came to deſtroy the law,</hi> or, <hi>to oppoſe it, I came to fulfill it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for that which is commonly called the moral law, or law of manners, Chriſt fulfilled it; 1 By being <hi>made under the law for us, Gal.</hi> 4.4. and after being made a curſe for our tranſgreſſions of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. 2 By imputing and placing us righteous before God when we once believe on Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous, or as the word ſignifies <hi>[conſtituentur]</hi> placed righteous, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 He fulfills it in us by writing the law of God in our hearts <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.33. and working in us a bent and reſpect to all the commandements of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6.</p>
                  <p>Now, beſides whath hath been ſaid, the reaſons I give for ſo opening this Scripture, are both, that 1 There may be no claſhing betwixt this Scripture and thoſe mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>I through the law</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſt) <hi>am dead to the law</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of Moſes) alſo <hi>John</hi> 8.17. <hi>It is written in your law,</hi> alſo <hi>John</hi> 15.25. <hi>It is written in their law,</hi> alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.2, 3, 4. ſaith, <hi>as the wife is free from the husband by his death, ſo are we free from the law by the ſacrifice of Chriſt,</hi> and ſo

                  <p>The Rabbins and other Jews had ſuch a ſollicitous care, that they had not onely a moſt exact account of the ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and verſes, but they took notice of the Letters of the Alphabet, as how often <hi>Aleph</hi> and <hi>Beth</hi> and other Letters
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:171178:116"/>were mentioned in the Old Teſtament, ſo that there could not fail a title which would not from that wonderfull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be reſtored.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Here might be a queſtion mentioned by <hi>Prideaux de Punctorum Hebr. origine.</hi> Seeing <hi>Iota's</hi> and titles or points are reckoned alike, if the points were not in that time, why doth Chriſt mention them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There are three opinions concerning the beginning of the Hebrew points, 1 That they were brought in with the Letters on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to God: of this opinion was <hi>Picus Mirandula, Junius, Polanus,</hi> and <hi>Broughton,</hi> and many others, both Jews and Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 A ſecond opinion, that theſe points came in about the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> as <hi>Reuclin, Buxtorf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The third opinion that they came in after the finiſhing of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and the threefold <hi>Maſorah,</hi> final, textual, and Marginal, 500. years after Chriſt, which is aſcribed to the <hi>Tiberians</hi> thoſe wiſe men.</p>
                  <p>For this opinion <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite is the Standard Bearer, whom beſides many Papiſts, <hi>Luther, Fagius, Druſius,</hi> and <hi>Martinius</hi> follow, and to this opinion this Author leans.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>Origen, Hierom, Philo,</hi> and other ancient tranſlators never once mention theſe points, and take away theſe points there's nothing will be taken away from the certainty of reading, as to matter and ſence, but onely in reſpect of pronunciation, and eaſineſſe of learners.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In other Oriental tongues the points are later then the conſonants, why not then in the Hebrew, ſeeing they draw their beginning from it? Theſe points were added, not as elements of the tongue together with conſonants, but as diſtinctive and directive, that the tongue might be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved pure among ſo many calamities, and might more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perceived, and more exactly pronounced by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the Septuagint tranſlated the Old Teſtament
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:171178:116"/>out of the Hebrew text unpointed. Many other reaſons may be ſeen in this Author.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwer to the queſtion, theſe tittle or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, are certain pointed tops of letters, parts of letters, but points are not parts but added to the letters. There are two titles, one of the Law, the other of Letters, the Text ſpeaks of the former.</p>
                  <p>Beſides diſtinguiſh betwixt the riſe of points and the perfecting of them, whereby they went along with the text. <hi>Ezra</hi> for the more eaſie knowledge of the text might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſome things, and might paſſe it over to his ſucceſſors, who might increaſe them, and therefore they might in Chriſts time be profitably in uſe in the Synagogue as the Text ſhews, yet it followes not that the Text was pointed, or that the Art of pointing was before the <hi>Tiberians,</hi> which was 476 years after Chriſt, who lived at <hi>Tiberias</hi> in <hi>Galilec.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall in no wiſe paſs from the Law]</hi> That is, ſhall not paſſe without fulfilling. But Chriſt of purpoſe handles this matter more darkly, leſt he ſhould offend the tender mindes of the Apoſtles with thoſe things, which they could not well bear, till the ſpirit was given, <hi>who ſhould lead them into all truth, Joh.</hi> 16.13.</p>
                  <p>So that the force of the argument is, if one <hi>Iota</hi> or <hi>Jod,</hi> or one point of a <hi>Jod</hi> cannot periſh, much leſs can the whole Law periſh till all be fulfilled. If we look to the letter <hi>Iota</hi> and not the Hebrew <hi>Jod,</hi> ſome would gather it as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote in Greek, but I have proved the contrary before, and Chriſt ſpeaking to the Hebrews ſaith one <hi>Jod,</hi> as the Syriack and Hebrew hath it, as <hi>Lapide</hi> tells us, and the Greek Interpreter for <hi>Jod</hi> put in the Greek <hi>Iota</hi> which is equivalent.</p>
                  <p>So that the ſenſe is, there is not the leaſt thing (ſuch as is <hi>Jod</hi> and <hi>Iota</hi>) of thoſe things which are written in the Law concerning me and my actions and myſteries, which ſhall not in every point be fulfilled.</p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:171178:117"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Till all be fulfilled]</hi> That is, till all things that are written in the Law and the Prophets 1 Concerning me and my actions be fulfilled, 2 Till all things commanded, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and threatened be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven: but, whoſoever ſhall do and teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the words two things, 1 A Threatning, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break one of Gods Commands, and teach others ſo, he ſhall be called leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 A Promiſe, <hi>But whoſoever ſhall do and teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments]</hi> The ſcope of this place ſhews that this Verſe hath reſpect unto the Teachers. <hi>Hierom</hi> refers it to the words of the Law, but others of the Ancients to the Commands of the Kingdom of Heaven, which are the fulfilling of the Law. Therefore Chriſt ſaith not, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break one of the leaſt of</hi> thoſe <hi>Commandments,</hi> but of <hi>theſe,</hi> having reſpect to the foregoing Commandments, to which bleſſedneſs was promiſed, and to other Commands of an holy Example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo to the following Commands which contain a more large explication of things which are of eternal equity. Chriſt argues, If it were lawfull for no man to break the Law, much leſs to break the Commands of the Goſpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Every tranſgreſsion and diſobedience of the Law received a juſt recompence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Yea, Chriſt ſaith, Whoſoever ſhall by his interpretation weaken the Law of Chriſt, as the Phariſees did againſt whom Chriſt preached, inſtructing his Apoſtles and Meſſengers to be Teachers of another Sect, and that they are not to deprave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt by falſe Expoſitions as the Phariſees did.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The leaſt of theſe Commandments]</hi> That is, there is not the leaſt Command in theſe Sermons of Chriſt which any man can deſpiſe without the loſs of ſalvation. Some carry it to the Law of Nature contained in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the Phariſees called ſmall in reſpect of their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which they gave a greater perfection than to Gods commands, which is not to be deſpiſed. Some think Chriſt hath reſpect to the diſtinction which the Phariſees gave of the Commands, to wit, greateſt and leaſt, the greateſt to be them which commanded external obedience, as, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, &amp;c.</hi> the leaſt which commanded the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the affections, as anger, wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are called leaſt, not becauſe they were ſo, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſo in the Phariſees opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhall teach men ſo]</hi> That is, or ſhall teach men ſo, the Conjunction is put for a Disjunction: he means whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall teach theſe falſe interpretations of the Law in the Church, and ſcatter his Errours, as the <hi>Phariſees, Sadduces,</hi> and <hi>Herodians</hi> then did, and ſo led perſons into ſeducement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So]</hi> That is, to do as himſelf doth, who keeps not the Commands of Chriſt, and teaches others that they are not to be kept.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſhall be called leaſt in the Kingdom of God]</hi> When thou art called leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven ſuſpect Hell and puniſhment. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> that is, he ſhall be nothing accounted of when the end of the World ſhall come. <hi>He ſhall be called,</hi> that is, he ſhall then be pronounced ſo to be by the Judg, by the Sentence of which Judg it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how great every man is, and in what eſtate he ſhall be. Neither ſhall he be in no place, becauſe he ſhall riſe again and be judged, but he ſhall be in the laſt place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhall be caſt into utter darkneſs. Some by leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand no place there at the Judgment, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1.6. <hi>The wicked ſhall not ſtand in judgment.</hi> Others underſtand the laſt place: this word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>But whoſoever ſhall do and teach]</hi> Theſe words though they principally look at Teachers, yet are they not ſo to be bound to them that others ſhould be excluded, for it is the duty of all Chriſtians, not onely to go before others by example, but by admonition and inſtruction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. It's ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He began both to do and teach.</hi> Whoſoever ſhall do and teach both great and ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that is, whoſe bent of heart is for all the Commandments. Teachers muſt not look for any Crown, if they do not practiſe that which they teach others; they are like unto High-way Marks, which ſhew the way to others but do not go in it themſelves.</p>

                     <hi>The ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven]</hi> That is, pronounced happy and bleſſed at that day, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12 2. <hi>They that turn many to righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> They ſhall be called great, Teacher and Fathe of the Diſciples, and Children whom he hath begotten. Hence it behoves every Teacher who expects this Crown, to examine whether what he teaches unto others himſelf do firſt ſet upon the practiſe thereof, leſt it be ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf?</hi> Teachers that know, and teach, and do not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, they are like <hi>Uriah</hi> that carried the Letters of his own death; or like the Philoſophers that ſaw little fruit of their teaching of virtue, becauſe thoſe things they taught others themſelves did not practiſe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point, I do by all that is ſaid ſtabliſh the ten Commandments, ſo far as what is contained in them is of the Law of Nature, and not altered in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> but compleated; and for any other part of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:171178:118"/>Law of Nature which was commanded in the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> I judg it to be eſtabliſhed, as alſo all the Evangelical Promiſes and Precepts of the Law are eſtabliſhed by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Do we then make void the Law through Faith? Nay, we eſtabliſh the Law. Tertul. de pudicitiâ,</hi> we ſtabliſh the Law, to wit, in thoſe things which being alſo now brought in by the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are forbid <hi>cumulatiore praecepto,</hi> by a more heaped Command; for, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, Who ſo looks upon a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to luſt after her hath already committed Adultery in his heart;</hi> and for <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, who ſo ſhall ſay to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Racha, <hi>ſhall be guilty of Hell.</hi> See then whether the Law of not committing Adultery be not ſafe to which the Law of not luſting hath come or been added? In a word, whatſoever is laid down in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which was not either ceremonial, or proper to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Common-wealth onely, and peculiar to their Church-ſtate onely, or hath not been nullified by ſome Commandment of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is and ought to be of perpetual obſervation, by all Chriſtians, as being holy juſt and good; and I muſt ſay as <hi>Juſtin</hi> to <hi>Tripho,</hi> I am altogether perſwaded there is no Scripture diverſe from another, I will rather confeſs I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the things that are ſpoken. <hi>Page</hi> 225.</p>
                  <p>For to diminiſh any thing from Gods Word is far from me, onely I have endeavoured to reconcile where any thing ſeems contrary in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> to the <hi>Old.</hi> One Title of the Word is greater than Heaven and Earth, ſaid <hi>Luther.</hi> Among all the gifts of God this is one of the largeſt, he that takes away this doth as it were take away the Sun out of the World; for take away the Word, what is the World but a Hell, notwithſtanding all the glorious things in it?</p>
                  <p>Howbeit I ſhall not forbear to write what <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who when he writ his ſecond Epiſtle to the Emperor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi> he ſaith, it was then 150 years from the birth of

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt retorts the accuſation of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, that they oppoſed and depraved the law, not in the leaſt Commandements, but in the greateſt; which Chriſt ſets down, generally in this <hi>verſe,</hi> ſpecially in the following verſes: in this verſe, becauſe they teach ſuch a righteouſneſs as excludes out of heaven; for they did not onely teach a righteouſneſs of works, but obliged their hearers onely to outward duties, ſo that if they did not kill a man, or lye with another mans wife, nor take away with their hands another mans goods, they were juſt in thoſe commands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed]</hi> That is, except your righteouſneſs overcome that obedience which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees]</hi> He names theſe ſects, becauſe they had gotten an opinion of holineſs above other ſects, as the <hi>Herodians</hi> and <hi>Eſſeans,</hi> from which holineſs they were far enough, but if you ask what this righteouſneſs was, we may ſee from <hi>Paul</hi> brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. which conſiſted 1 In an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unblameableneſs, and in oppoſing ſuch ſins as hindred civil ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the law forbad heart ſins, as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward offences, the Phariſees interpreted ſin rather accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to to the mind of their counſel, then to the mind of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:171178:120"/>Gods law: and for theſe inward ſins they were done away by their daily ſacrifice. And therefore <hi>Tripho</hi> diſputing againſt <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſaith, The commandements of the Goſpel ſeem to be ſo great and wonderful that they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of any man, to wit the commands of inward inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. And therefore <hi>Joſephus</hi> cenſures <hi>Polybius</hi> for aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the death of <hi>Antiochus</hi> to an intentional ſacriledge, though not committed. For the Phariſees outward righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.25, 26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In civill righteouſneſs and juſt dealing with men, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they could never have gained that opinion of ſanctity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In partial righteouſneſs; for doubtleſs they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome of Gods commands with much ſeeming devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in paying tithe of <hi>Mint, Anniſe</hi> and <hi>Cummin, Matth.</hi> 23.23. mean time they omitted judgement, mercy and faith.</p>
                  <p>Hence 1 See the folly of men. Carnal profeſſors who content themſelves with either 1 Civility in dealing juſtly with men as the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. Or 2 With formality becauſe they pray, read, faſt, give almes, yet all theſe things did the Phariſees. External righteouſneſs is that moſt look after, never looking to the evils of their hearts, as malice, pride, &amp;c. neither to ſuppreſs them nor to be humbled for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 See how far many are from heaven, who have not ſo much as theſe Phariſees had, not ſo much as an external righteouſneſs, open ſwearers, drunkards, ſcoffers at goodneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 See that if you come to heaven you muſt get a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs exceeding all phariſaicall righteouſneſs; this is had onely by Chriſt, who being made over unto us for <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> by <hi>faith,</hi> Gal. 2.16.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven]</hi> That is, into the ſtate of glory, becauſe the <hi>kingdom of heaven</hi> is joyned with the word <hi>enter.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Entering into the kingdome of heaven is oppoſed to hell fire, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.47, 48. This name of the kingdome of heaven was never mentioned in the old Teſtament, but onely wrapt up in certain ſignes, ſhadowes and types.</p>
                  <p>And therefore this not entring into the kingdome of heaven, is not meant of a Church conſiſting of Paſtor, of People, as if ſuch perſons that practiſed external or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al righteouſneſs were unworthy to be teachers in the Church, but Chriſt ſpeaks to all his diſciples that they look that they have a righteouſneſs both of doctrine and life exceeding Scribes and Phariſees.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt doth not ſhow what this more abundant righteouſneſs is, becauſe his ſcope was not here to teach what this righteouſneſs is, but onely to convince the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees who were teachers of a falſe righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. <hi>Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old time, Thou ſhalt not kill, and, whoſoever ſhall kill ſhall be in danger of the judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt proves in ſpeciall to the end of the Chapter that the Phariſees were falſifyers of the law, and ſo retorts the accuſation that was by the Phariſees caſt upon him, upon themſelves, becauſe either they depraved the words of the law, as concerning murder, divorce, and ſwearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe coldly expounded it of the letter, never looking to the obedience of the heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old]</hi> Theſe words are refer'd to the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 1 Becauſe the word <hi>[old]</hi> hath reſpect unto a long continued oldneſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.8, 19.

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.9. 2 Becauſe the words that Chriſt recites and mentions are the ſame that are found in the Law, ſometimes without addition of any Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as <hi>v.</hi> 27, 31, 33, 38. So that Chriſt ſpeaks not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them that had ſpoken to him, but to the Diſciples and to the multitude, and to the imperfections of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law. This Covenant of the new Teſtament, much excels that Covenant given on Mount <hi>Sinai, Gal.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. Chriſt was the mediator of a better Covenant, which was ſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</p>
                  <p>But indeed both theſe interpretations are to be taken; for Chriſt doth oppoſe himſelf to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> as to the Scribes, and ſupplies the imperfections and defects of them both, for the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was imperfect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt perfected it by the Law of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill]</hi> Many thought that by this Law one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murther was forbid, but Chriſt teacheth that wrath, ſtrokes, reproaches and murtherous words, the fore-going of murther, was forbid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And whoſoever killeth ſhall be in danger of judgement]</hi> That is, ſhall be put to death by the Civil Magiſtrate, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.12, 14. <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Numb.</hi> 34.16, 17, 18, 19.30.33. this was to be done, leſt the land ſhould be defiled with bloud: for though now judgement of life and death was executed by the Romans, yet was their manner of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment known to all, and freſh in every mans memory. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> ſaith there were ſeven of theſe Judges, to which there were fourteen Aſſeſſors, who were moſtly of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, to theſe there were one or two ſupernumeraries, which make up three and twenty, which the Hebrews ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſay was the number.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſpeak a little concerning this command of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, there was a two-fold killing;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Caſual, when a man meant no harm, yet accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kil'd a man, as by throwing a tyle from an houſe, or an
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:171178:121"/>axes head flyes off, and kills a man as he was hewing wood. in this caſe the thing being done ignorantly, there was a City of refuge, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.5, 6. <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. Such a man was to remain in the City of refuge till the High Prieſts death, and if the avenger of blood took him without that City he might kill him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Voluntary, when perſons have murtherous intentions, either by ſword, piſtol, club, or poyſon, to take away any mans life, ſo thoſe that hinder conception, or procure ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortion, by potions, ignorant Phyſicians, ſo thoſe who ſhall deſire the death of their parents, or friends, to have their eſtate, or the death of their husbands or wives, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe they are ſtraitned to maintain them, or out of a deſire to enlarge their condition, ſo thoſe that ſhall not feed the poor in ſome caſes, when they are in danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. This command is a hedge for the preſervation of the life of man.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 This murther is either of the heart, as wrath, envy, hatred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Of the tongue, as to wiſh evil to our neighbour, as to wiſh him dead, or to give him provoking ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Of the hand; This is ſo much more hainous, by how much the perſon is more near related to us in conſanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                  <p>Nor is the inventor onely, but alſo the ſhedder of blood guilty. Not onely <hi>David</hi> who contrived <hi>Uriahs</hi> death, but alſo <hi>Joab</hi> who was the ſhedder.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the judgement]</hi> By the judgement he means the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the three and twenty men, of which I ſpake before, they had alſo a judgement of three men, who judged of money matters, though ſometimes this counſell was called the Synedrion, yet for diſtinction ſake that ſame aſſembly
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:171178:124"/>of three and twenty was called the judgement, becauſe they judged of murthers and inflicted death, and the other great counſel was called the Sanhedrim or Synedrion, from the different degrees of puniſments among the Jews. Chriſt would ſhow the degrees of puniſhment in another world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatneſs of ſin, as if he ſhould ſay, Look as among you Jews there are different offences, ſome are judged in your counſel of three and twenty, and ſome in your great Sanhedrim, and that with the higheſt puniſhment which you have to inflict, that is to ſay burning, ſo in the court of heaven ſome ſins, as raſh anger, are leſs ſentenced, others more ſorely, as when our anger ſhall break forth to railing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother Racha]</hi> Racha is a <hi>Syriack</hi> word, and ſignifies (as <hi>Lapide</hi> and others collect from learned men) 1 Empty, as empty of wealth or poor, or as ſome, empty of brain or wit. 2 It ſignifies ſpittle or ſpit upon, to ſignifie they eſteemed one another no better then the ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they ſpat out of their mouths. 3 It ſignifies contemned, vile, deſpiſed, abject, and in this ſignification <hi>Michael Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronita</hi> in his proeme of the Syriack Grammer thinks it to be taken: the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> expounds Racha thus, he that ſhall ſay to his brother, he poor by contempt and of torn gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhall be guilty of the counſel.</p>

This Counſel ſat at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and its ſuppoſed theſe ſeventy were ſet over them, in remembrance of the 70 ſouls <hi>Jacob</hi> brought into <hi>Egypt,</hi> theſe ruled over them ſometimes, and ſome think <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made them their taskmaſters; theſe went part of the way into the mount with <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 24.9.

                  </p>
                  <p>If there were any thing more dark or more intricate that fell out among the Judges of cities, they were to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this counſell, whereof the high prieſt was one, and I take it moſtly the preſident therein, all, both inferiour Judges and private perſons, were commanded to obey their anſwer on pain of death, againſt them that ſhould oppoſe.

In this Senate both matters of God and matters of the King and kingdome were handled, and that they might be incouraged herein, <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> tells them they had <hi>Amariah,</hi> a man well skilled in judgements and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> a man well skilled in civill affairs, and divers of the Levites excelling in other learning. So great was their authority that of ſome cauſes the king himſelf did not judge, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.5. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſaith the King can do nothing againſt you. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> note that the king came not into the Sanhedrim, leaſt his opinion ſhould take liberty of judging from others, who thought diverſly from him.</p>
                  <p>For this ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.16, 17, 18. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> mentions theſe 70 old men, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.11, 12. and <hi>Jazaniah</hi> was chief: the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay theſe ſeventy retained their authority in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> eſtabliſhed this power when they came out of the captivity, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 7.25, 26. after when they took up armes againſt <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the government of things was in this Senate, in which Court the kingly Scepter was kept. This order continued till <hi>Herod</hi> the great, who ſlew them all (as a juſt judgement becauſe theſe Senators had neglected to bridle his boldneſs and power) except one <hi>Sameas,</hi> whom they had oft contemned admoniſhing ſuch things, in the room of whom <hi>Herod</hi> appointed others of his own faction. After, in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his time, the power of this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:171178:125"/>Senate came to be ſtrainted, the power of life and death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from them, and divers other counſels ſet up in ſeveral cities about civil affairs. Yet it is mentioned in the new Teſtament. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.50. of theſe <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was one, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> another, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.6, 7. alſo <hi>Acts</hi> 5.21. This counſel is diſtinguiſhed from the Senate, or city Magiſtracy of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo alſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.66. <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Titus,</hi> this Senate came to an end.</p>
                  <p>So that the meaning of what is ſpoken, is, there is ſuch proportion betwixt wrath and a reproachful word, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the puniſhment of both, as there is betwixt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the three and twenty, or the Synedrion, or chief Council; as this exceeds that, ſo the puniſhment of a reproachfull word exceeds the puniſhment of anger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou fool, ſhall be guilty of hell fire]</hi> Some give this interpretation, you Hebrews bring perſons for anger and reviling to the Council, alluding to their manner of proceeding, but I for the ſame ſin threaten a greater puniſhment unto them, even hell fire.</p>
                  <p>But the more common interpretation is, whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou fool, ſhall be guilty of hell fire, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The word tranſlated hell, properly ſignifies the fire of <hi>Gehenna.</hi> Without the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there was a place called <hi>Gehenna,</hi> or, the Valley of the ſon of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> wherein was a place called <hi>Tophet, Jer.</hi> 7.31, 32. where the Jews after the example of the Phoenicians, burnt their children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> timbrels and pipes making a noiſe, leſt the cry of the burnt childe ſhould be heard. <hi>Joſiah</hi> polluted this place by bringing dead carkaſſes into it, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.10. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.32. It was alſo called <hi>Tophet,</hi> which as <hi>Lapide</hi> ſaith, ſignifies a Timbrel, from the playing upon timbrels there. It was called <hi>Ghehinnom</hi> of <hi>Ghe, i.e. A Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and <hi>Hinnom</hi> the name of a <hi>Jew.</hi> It was a pleaſant Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but becauſe of this horrible burning of their children, the Jews hereby ſignified the torment of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:171178:125"/>damned. <hi>Eſai</hi> 30.33. <hi>Tophet is prepared of old, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord like a ſtream of brimſtone doth kindle it.</hi> As the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable infants ſhut up in a brazen Idol, fire being put under, were broyl'd and burnt with an unſpeakable torment, ſo the wicked in the priſon of hell, ſhall be tormented with unquenchable fire.</p>
                  <p>Now the cauſe for which among others, is, for paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate railing, and calling fool, that is a wicked man, who in Scripture is ſo called, not a natural fool, or under-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but a wicked man, a contemner of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God,</hi> then which there is hardlier a more grievous railing, eſpecially when it is done, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, without cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet this doth not hinder, but that thoſe, who have a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of chaſtiſing others, may be ſharply reproved, that they may be rowſed out of their ſleepineſs, as Chriſt cals his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25. <hi>O fools, and ſlow of heart,</hi> and to the Phariſees, <hi>Matth,</hi> 23.17, 19. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>fooliſh Galatians, Gal.</hi> 3.1. and Chriſt calls the Phariſees, <hi>Generations of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Matth.</hi> 23.33. reſembles them to <hi>graves</hi> and <hi>whited ſepulchres, v.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this verſe, for the prevention of our hearts to break out into anger and ſo to railing, Ile lay down ſome conſiderations about anger, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What it is. <hi>A.</hi> It's an affection whereby the bloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the heart, being heated by the apprehenſion of ſome injury offered to a mans ſelf or friend, and that in truth or in opinion, the appetite is ſtir'd up to take revenge.</p>
                  <p>Its two-fold, 1 Juſt, and this is two-fold, 1 created, ſo anger was in <hi>Adam</hi> to riſe up againſt all that ſhould tempt him to ſin, knowing that in the day he ſinn'd he ſhould dye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Renewed, whereby we are angry at our own or other mens ſins, ſo <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32.32. he was ſo angry that he ſlew three thouſand who were actors in the golden Calf.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:171178:126"/>
                     <hi>Phineas</hi> ſlew <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi, Numb.</hi> 25.7, 8. ſo we may have a juſt anger, when our own name, or ſtate, or wife, or life is violated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is an unjuſt anger, which is when we have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge ſtirr'd up in us upon unjuſt cauſes; <hi>Jon.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Now that thy anger may be juſt and not ſinful, conſider, 1 The properties of holy anger. 2 The remedies againſt ſinful anger.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The properties of holy anger, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It muſt have a juſt cauſe, <hi>Exo.</hi> 11.8. <hi>Moſes</hi> went from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in a great anger: <hi>Lot</hi> was angry with the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It muſt be proportioned to the fault. We muſt not bring a club to kill a flye, nor ſet an houſe on fire to roſt an egg. Here <hi>Jonah</hi> fail'd, who was ſo angry for a gourd, and the Diſciples who for a contempt would have had fire come down from heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.53.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 With love of thoſe with whom we are angry; ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> pray'd for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he was ſo angry at their golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 In matters of importance, not for trifles. There's more juſtice then love in ſuch a carriage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It muſt be ſhort; the Sun muſt not go down upon it leſt it boyl up into malice, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.26. and ſo much the ſhorter, as we ſee ſignes of repentance in the perſon offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Abſaloms</hi> long retained anger turn'd into malice, and in fine to murther.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It muſt be moderate. Not as <hi>Simoon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who ſlew innocent as well as guilty, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.25. Some are like cruel hangmen, who having a juſt cauſe to execute the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to wit, the Judges command, do in the execution thereof uſe all cruelty.

To think a man loves us not becauſe he comes not ſo oft to our houſe when perhaps his buſineſs will not permit, or becauſe we ſee a man laugh, to think, he laughs at us.</p>

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:171178:128"/>with him, and herein Chriſt ſhowes two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That unleſs we be reconciled to our brother, all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of godlineſs, as prayers, hearing, receiving are nothing worth; therefore as oft as we come to the worſhip of God, we muſt cleanſe our hearts from theſe. So the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2.

This ſhould be a ground of humiliation for all ſuch carriages, when we come before the Lord. No voluntary offerings, whether coſtly or of free-will, that are offered with an angry heart do pleaſe God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fooliſhly did the Phariſees ſuppoſe that gifts offered in the Temple did expiate ſins, which the Judges did not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, though there were no amendment of heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That in vain perſons profeſs themſelves to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God, who offend their brethren, and after proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemn them, for under one kinde Chriſt points out all outward exerciſes of worſhip, wherein men counterfeit godlineſs, rather then truly witneſs it. <hi>If we give all our goods to the poor and have not charity, it profits not.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This may comfort thee, thou haſt done thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs.</hi> Chriſt abſolves thee, if thou ſeek Reconciliation and canſt not obtain it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if the Supper of the Lord be here meant, and I know no abſurdity in including of it, how neceſſary is it for Brethren to be united, hence it's called a Communion, that is a common union betwixt Chriſt and Believers: and indeed this Unity and Love is the Badg of Chriſt's Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we tell an apparant Ly when we come to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and have not an Union with our Brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. We being many are one Bread and one Body; in token of vvhich Union Chriſtians before the Supper gave an holy kiſs one to another, as <hi>Lapide</hi> obſerves.</p>
                  <p>This muſt be limited to reſpect time and place, for if the perſon offended be far from thee, then let thy affection go to him, and give ſatisfaction as ſoon as thou canſt, onely we may ſee how unholy a thing Diſcord and Strife is, that it unhallovvs every ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Chriſt condemns ſelfiſhneſs, whereby too oft we ſtand too much upon our own right, even to loſs of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, contrary to <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. Let your moderation in remitting of your right, <gap reason="foreign">

Job</hi> 31.1. <hi>I have made a covenant with mine eyes, v.</hi> 7. <hi>No blot hath cleaved to my hands,</hi> alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>his foot haſtened not to deceit;</hi> the meaning of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is, that the nouriſhment of luſt is to be avoided; luſt travelling with a ſinfull act, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14, 15. if it be hindered to bring it forth, that ſinful act becomes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortive, and luſt it ſelf dies.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this command, as all other commands that ſeem to command wickedneſs or ſin, ought to be taken figuratively, literally this precept were a breach of the ſixt command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> and ſo it were a cruel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:171178:135"/>but it is a moſt gentle Command: it had been hard if he had bid us keep company with women, behold them, and abſtain from them. <hi>Julian</hi> taking theſe ſentences lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mockt at Chiſtian Religion as fooliſh, cruel and vain, becauſe it commands to maim our own members: He mockt at Chriſtians becauſe no man did it, he mock at Chriſt becauſe no man obeyed him; but this Apoſtate might have ſeen from the ſcope, that theſe words were not to be taken literally, but figuratively. For Chriſt teacheth this, ſeeing there is ſo much danger of the eyes that they are as gates to let luſt in and out, they are to be pluckt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vanity, yea to be pluckt out rather then be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Some of the ancients underſtood by <hi>right hand</hi> kindred and friends, any dear thing which draws from God, but here is meant all occaſions of luſt taken from the eye in particular, ſuch was that curioſity of looking into the Ark of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19.</p>

Though corruption be in you, let it be like a dead carkaſs. 1 God works habitual or inward mortification, not onely by raiſing up thoſe that are dead in ſin, but by ſtirring up the affections of the ſoul to a deſire of raiſing, and then crucifying ſinfull affections or luſts in us. 2 For outward actual mortification, that is our work, hereby we reſiſt temptations and keep in inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affections.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt further clears the ſeventh Commandement, aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this command is broken if a man ſhall put away his wife except for fornication; the Law allowed divorce in divers caſes, but Chriſt onely in the caſe of fornication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It hath been ſaid]</hi> 1 By <hi>Moſes,</hi> from divine inſpiration, not upon his own private fancie; for the commandements and ſtatutes which <hi>Moſes</hi> taught them, the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for to teach them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.1. for he that would not determine in a matter of inheritance (as in the caſe of the daughters of <hi>Zelophehad</hi>) without firſt asking God, in a matter of greater moment, would not do any thing without Gods command: and though Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.8. aſcribes divorce unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet thoſe things which came from God are aſcribed to <hi>Moſes, Matth.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.44.7.10. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.14.</p>
                  <p>Now this divorce was made for ſome kind of filthineſs, as for leproſie, ſcolding, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 1 For it was ſcarcely uſed in caſe of fornication, for if the wickedneſs of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeared, the adultereſs was ſtoned, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.10. and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:171178:136"/>if ſhe were ſuſpected ſhe was purged with the waters of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.27. and God diſpenſing with the <hi>Jews</hi> for to put away their wives for ſundry cauſes, they did not ſin herein in my opinion. <hi>Ob.</hi> But <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Moſe</hi> becauſe of the hardneſs of your hearts ſuffered you to put away your wives, therefore it was onely a permiſſion. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This their hardneſs was the cauſe why God granted the <hi>Jews</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty herein, leſt the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould kill their wives whom they could not put away, yet this grant did make their putting away lawful, becauſe God for the hardneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> did diſpenſe with them in the law of matrimony: by this putting away of wives, God typified the putting away of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the betrothing of the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſoever ſhall put away his wife]</hi> For onely the husband by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> law might put away the wife. The Phariſees corrupted this law of divorce: the original law was, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1. That if a man hated his wife for ſome filthineſs, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her a bill of divorce he might put her away, but might never take her any more after he had put her away. Now the Scribes and Phariſees depraving this law, the <hi>Jews</hi> for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall matter put away their wives, ſhowing the ſeventh Commandement was not violated if they gave them a bill of divorce; hence Chriſt reprehends this interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Now the form of this putting away, as the Lawyers tell, was, <hi>Tuas res tibi habeto, tuas res tibi agito,</hi> that is, look to thy own affairs, <hi>conditione tua non utar,</hi> in ſevering the betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things <hi>placuit renunciationem interv enire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let him give her a writing of divorcement]</hi> This was a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whereby the husband commanded his wife to depart from him. The form whereof was (as <hi>Grotius</hi> mentions) this, Of my own accord and no mans compulſion, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to leave, refuſe and put away from me thee, hitherto my wife, and even now do ſend thee away, forſake and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe thee, and caſt thee away from me, that thou mayeſt be in thy own power; and mayeſt depart whither thou liſteſt
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:171178:137"/>at thy own will and pleaſure, neither let any man at any time forbid it, and ſo be thou let go, that it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for thee to mary to what man thou wilt.</p>
                  <p>Now that it was lawfull for a man to put away his wife without bringing the cauſe to the judge, appears by Chriſts words; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It was ſpoken of them, he that putteth away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides elſe how could <hi>Joſeph</hi> have put away <hi>Mary</hi> privily. The ancient <hi>Gaules</hi> and other nations granted the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands power of life and death over their wives. <hi>Grotius.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks not of any putting away, but of that which was done to innocent Women, onely for Barrenneſs, upon which cauſe Divorce firſt began at <hi>Rome:</hi> and yet the <hi>Romans</hi> were an hundred and twenty years without an Example of putting away. <hi>Abraham,</hi> though <hi>Sarah</hi> was barren till ninety nine years of age, never put her away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſeth her to commit Adultery]</hi> How could this be?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> She that was put away being branded with the Reproach of Divorce could not get another Husband, and ſo being hopeleſs of marying, as being counted defiled (as <hi>Moſes</hi> phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it) turn'd Strumpet, now Chriſt caſts the fault hereof up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, who for a ſlight cauſe would put away his Wife. This is to expoſe the frail age of a young Woman to temptation. Hence <hi>M.T. Cicero</hi> was blamed, becauſe for light cauſes he put away his Wife <hi>Terentia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And whoſoever marieth her that is divorced committeth Adultery]</hi> Chriſt means it (as <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks) of one that is of the ſame Faith and Profeſſion, ſo that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of them who received thoſe that were put away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were Endeavours of Reconciliation uſed of one of them to the other. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>But if ſhe depart, let her remain unmaried, or be reconciled to her Husband.</hi> Alſo it's meant of thoſe who being greedy of other mens Wives, by Divorce made way to mary them. Hence <hi>Matth.</hi> 19 9. the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:171178:138"/>former Husband is ſaid to commit Adultery, if he ſhall mary another, ſo that the Crime of Adultery falls on him, he hath taken away all hope of agreement betwixt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer yoke-fellows, ſo that hereby Chriſt would eſtabliſh hope of Reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe <hi>Moſes</hi> Law ſtanding in force as it did then, it had been hard that they that had maried a Woman put away ſhould be counted for Adulterers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What do you think of this caſe when a Husband remains a certain time from a Wife, whether another man may mary with her?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The abſent party is either beyond ſeas, or in his own countrey. If beyond ſeas, there muſt be a greater time granted to hear of him. By the Law of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> if the Wife did not hear of the ſafety of the Husband in four years ſhe was permitted to mary to another.</p>
                  <p>To give my opinion, there muſt be a preciſe time ſet down, wherein if the Wife do not hear of the Husband it may be lawfull to mary, as if being in the ſame Nation he do not ſend to her in two years, or if being in a foreign Nation he do not ſend to her in four years, for in ſuch a ſpace of time it may be ſuppoſed a man may write from any part of the Earth; unleſs he be in captivity: ſuch a Man not ſending to his Wife in ſuch a ſpace of time may be ſuppoſed to put her away, howbeit I think in theſe caſes to conſider ſeriouſly what the Laws of the Nation are is moſt expedient, and ſo far as they concur with lawfulneſs and expediency to follow them.</p>
                  <p>For Application, 1 <hi>Caution,</hi> Not to put away Wife or Husband: there are four Miſchiefs in it, 1 Such an one is a Murderer, becauſe he hates his Wife. If Chriſtians are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was the judgment of <hi>Calvin</hi> and the other <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian</hi> Preachers, that there might be a Divorce, whereof there were two Examples; one of <hi>Pizarro,</hi> who maried a Wife who would not live with him, ſave in the <hi>Roman</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, where he muſt either deny the Faith, or loſe his

                  <p>And ſo much more ought we to be adviſed, becauſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is that point upon which depends in a great meaſure our eternal Eſtate, for the Eſtate it ſelf it is but for a few years, but eternal things both of our ſelves and poſterity much depend upon it.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 To ſtabliſh the conſciences of competent Judges in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting divorces; when one of the perſons is a fornicator, it is of the light of nature that he that keeps not the conditions of a contract or bargain ſhould loſe the benefit of it, and the contract be made void; that whoredome was a juſt cauſe of divorce in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, was in reſpect of gentle husbands who would not have their wives put to death; ſuch an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Mary:</hi> or in reſpect of ſuch husbands, who though they believed their wives were ſtrumpets, and perhaps found them ſo, yet they were not able to prove it in judgement, the proper puniſhment thereof was death, either burning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.24. or ſtoning, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.5. but now Chriſt warrants any Judge to proceed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce in this caſe of adultery.</p>

It's called a rowl, becauſe the Jews books were not diſtinct by leaves as we have, but one piece of parchment wrapt upon a ſtick like a map, which was called a rowl, becauſe rowled together. In this was writ their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and the puniſhments of them; it's ſaid to be flying, to ſignifie the ſwift vengeance that hangs over impenitent perſons, it hangs as it were in the ayr waiting for Gods command to fall down like an Eagle, or Hawk upon the prey. They went as ſwift in their ſins as wilde Aſſes or Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medaries,

The length of this rowl was 20 cubits, the breadth but ten, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that it went over all <hi>Judaea,</hi> which was twice as long as broad, as <hi>Hierom</hi> obſerves: the length of it from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba</hi> was 160 miles, the breadth from <hi>Joppa</hi> to <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was 46 miles. This rowl was writ on both ſides, on one ſide of it were curſes for the thief, on the other ſide curſes for the ſwearer.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this curſe is ſaid to remain in the midſt of his houſe, and ſhall conſume it with the timber thereof and the ſtones thereof. This was fulfill'd, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27, 28.24.1. in that there was not left one ſtone upon another, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Temple deſtroyed, but alſo every private mans houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.44. ſo that they were laid even with the ground, and not one ſtone left upon another.</p>

                  <p>Examples of perſons puniſh'd for falſe ſwearing, are <hi>Zedekiah, Ezek.</hi> 17.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. the Lord threatens for the oath that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ſwore to the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> and brake, that he ſhould dye. <hi>Shimei</hi> was put to death for the oath he brake which he had ſworn to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.42, 43, 44, 45.

                  <p n="1">1 Beware in thoſe caſes where men are apt to ſwear amiſs, as to gratifie a friend, or to be revenged of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Uſe not an oath when the matter can be otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; alſo if thou be a judge impoſe not an oath when not neceſſary, nor upon men of no credit, who make no conſcience of it, nor in matters of no moment, nor tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly and in haſte, nor when thou knows that which is ſworn will not, or cannot be performed, as ſome judges were wont to ſwear Church-wardens in times paſt, nor to make a perſon to accuſe himſelf, which is contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that a man ſhould puniſh himſelf. Oaths are good and profitable, but they are to be uſed as medicines, when there is neceſſity of them; not elſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Take heed of eaſineſs in ſwearing, yea and in calling God to witneſs; eaſe brings cuſtome, and cuſtome blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</p>

In an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry mans mouth, oaths are very frequent, and vain glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men think it a bravery to ſwear: prophane ſwearers would have other men think them ſo ſtout that they care neither for God nor man.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 Let it be with a due fear and reverence of the name of God, and of his Majeſty. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Good men fear an oath,</hi> that is they fear the glorious name of the Lord in their oath. So <hi>Athanaſius Serm. de paſsione et cruce domini,</hi> purging himſelf to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> in this manner, <hi>God is my witneſs and his Chriſt, that I never made mention of thee for evil to thy brother Conſtans Auguſtus, neither ſtirred up him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee. Pliny</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith) mentions that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were wont to bind themſelves with an oath, not for any wickedneſs, but that they would not commit thefts, robberies or adulteries; that they would not deceive nor deny a thing committed to their truſt, when it was called for.

                     <hi>But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all]</hi> That is not by any formes of oaths which are after mentioned, as by heaven or earth; to ſwear falſly is deſtructive, to ſwear truly is dangerous, not to ſwear is ſafe. The ſcope of Chriſt is to diſcover the Phariſees jugglings, who excuſed perſons from perjury when they ſwore by heaven and earth; though they broke their oaths, yet they declared them innocent from perjury, provided they ſwore not by the name of God. 2 Chriſt ſpeaks againſt all raſh and common ſwearing, whether by God or creatures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God] q. d.</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that is made by heaven redounds unto God, for in the creatures the Creator is underſtood, for they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, and all that they have they have it from God. Vainly then do you Phariſees ſay, If an oath be made by God it bindes, but it bindes not if it be made by creatures; He that ſwears by the creature either makes it God, which is Idolatry, or underſtands God in it.</p>
                  <p>So that Chriſt ſhows that all raſh ſwearing and all irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and abuſe of the name of God was forbid, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ſcribes doctrine, who taught the command was onely broken by perjury.</p>

                  <p>The ſcribes had another errour, that he that ſwore by the temple and altar was not bound, but he that ſwore by the gold of the temple, or the gift of the altar was bound, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.16. becauſe gold and the gift upon the altar tended to the prieſts gain.</p>
                  <p>The Jews were wont to ſwear by heaven, the Phariſees made nothing of it; hence Chriſt ſhows that he who ſwears by heaven and earth, ſwears by God who hath heaven for his throne, and earth for his foot-ſtool: he alludes to <hi>Eſai.</hi> 66.1. <hi>Heaven is my throne and earth is my foot-ſtool.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, becauſe an Oath is part of Gods worſhip, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. and this is a Superſtition, or a Super-inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in it,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe it confines our outward Worſhip to a bodily Service, which was never commanded by God, nor exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Saints. Now as the Chriſtians twenty years ago op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Bowing before the Altar, &amp; bowing towards the Eaſt, when it was impoſed, though herein they were required onely to bow to the God of Heaven and Earth, placing an abſoluteneſs in that which God left indifferent, ſo we in like manner may oppoſe this Superſtition of Confinement in Laying our Hand upon the Book, and kiſſing the Book in taking of an Oath, when God hath left it indifferent what geſture or outward ſignification we will expreſs. Hence the Scripture mentions variety of geſtures, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Putting the Hand under the Thigh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24 9. ſometimes lifting up the Hand to the moſt high God, <hi>Gen,</hi> 14.22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe in the Worſhip of God there is introduced a humane Invention, which ought not to be (ſeeing he that ows the Worſhip muſt appoint the manner how he will be worſhipped) That there is a humane Invention brought in, appears, becauſe that together with their ſwearing, they are at the ſame time required to lay their Hands upon the Book; now as ſome of the Non-conformiſts brought it as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:171178:144"/>an unanſwerable Reaſon, that the Croſs ought not to be uſed in Infant-baptiſm, but was will-worſhip, becauſe it was joyned with the worſhip of God, as it was then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted; and that it was joyned with the ſuppoſed worſhip of God, appeared, becauſe the worſhip was a good while begun before the Croſs was uſed, and after the Croſſing there was the ſaying the Lords Prayer, and a Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the Regeneration of the Infant. This Argument I producing once to a great learned Biſhop, he was not able to anſwer it, but was in a manner ſilenced at it. Let thoſe then be ſilenced who will offer to introduce Laying the Hand upon the Book in the Worſhip of an Oath, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it on others to obſerve their Invention.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It's unlawfull, becauſe Magiſtrates in ſome places place the eſſence of an Oath in Laying the Hand upon the Book, hence it's unlawfull; now in that they place the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an Oath in laying the Hand upon the Book, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe they will not give you an Oath unleſs you will ſwear in that manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe they think the Oath is not full without it: for though in the moſt religious manner you call the Searcher of hearts to witneſs, and though you are willing to lift up your hand to Heaven to the moſt high God, yet nothing wil ſerve, unleſs you lay your Hand upon the Book, they will not give you an Oath, witneſs Ald. <hi>Hook</hi> one of the Judges for Probate of Wills at <hi>Dublin,</hi> who thus refuſed the Teſtimonies and Oaths of me and another, who were Witneſſes to a Will, wherein the Legatees were onely a Widow and three very ſmall fatherleſs Children. As the calling of God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to confirm a truth by a perſon that diſcerns what an Oath is, is one part of the eſſence of an Oath, ſo theſe men would have Laying on of Hands on the Book to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the eſſence thereof, unleſs we may ſuppoſe that they make Swearing in the Worſhip of God to be the thing ſignified, and Laying the Hand upon the Book and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:171178:145"/>kiſſing it, to be the outward ſign thereof, ſo that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall be from Heaven, and the ſign from man, a groſſer preſumption than which there were not many in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 If there be any outward viſible geſture required in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an Oath, there being none commanded by God, it muſt be ſuch as is exemplified by God, Angels, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men; but not laying the Hand upon the Book, but lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the hand towards Heaven, is ſuch as is exemplified by God, Angels, and godly men; therefore, if any geſture be required, lifting up of the hand to Heaven muſt be it.</p>

In the life of <hi>William Thorp</hi> a Prieſt, A certain Clerk asking <hi>William Thorp</hi> if it were not lawful to kneel down and touch the holy Goſpel book, and kiſs it ſaying, So help me God and this holy doom, <hi>William Thorp</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of a diſcourſe betwixt a Lawyer and a Maſter of Divinity, The Maſter of Divinity ſaid, it was not lawfull to give or take any ſuch charge upon a book, for every book is nothing elſe but divers creatures, of which it is made of, therefore to ſwear upon a book is to ſwear by creatures, and this ſwearing is ever unlawfull: this ſentence witneſſeth <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> plainly blaming them greatly that bring forth a book to ſwear upon.

After a Clerk bidding him lay his hand upon the book, touching the holy Goſpel of God, <hi>William Thorp</hi> anſwered, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the holy Goſpel of God may not be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with mans hand, <hi>ibid.</hi> that is not unadviſedly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 37. <hi>But let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatſoever is more then theſe cometh of evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning of Chriſt here, is not to forbid ſwearing in juſt caſes, but prophane and raſh ſwearing, whether by God or creatures. This is mentioned, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12. as if he ſhould ſay, Let your ſpeech uſually be a bare affirmation or denial. For that which is added to theſe by calling God or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to witneſs cometh of evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea, yea; nay, nay]</hi> Chriſt notes to us the conſtancy that ſhould be alſo in our ſpeeches, without faltringor deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full equivocating, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Our word among you was not yea and nay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides Chriſt teaches that in promiſes not ſworn, our
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:171178:146"/>faith ought to be kept in like manner as if they had been ſworn, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. <hi>He that ſweareth to his own hurt and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not.</hi> So much appears, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, leſt you fall into condemnation.</hi> In ſtead of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>leſt you fall into hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,</hi> that is, leſt ye be found deceitfull, which becomes not Chriſtians. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Eſſens,</hi> Every thing that was ſpoken of them was ſtronger then an oath. Some there are that think promiſes have not a binding power, but a ſimple affirmation of a thing that in future we would do, ought to proceed from that minde, that at that time would do that thing which we ſay we would do in future. Yet he is not bound thereby, nor we are bound thereby, becauſe the will of man hath a power to change his decrees, neither can he take away that right from himſelf by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone reſpect of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>So that we muſt diſtinguiſh, 1 Betwixt the declaration of our minde, wherein we ſhow our preſent intentions, but yet with the reſervation of our future liberty of changing our preſent determination upon new reaſons we yet ſee not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 And betwixt a promiſe. For in a promiſe there is the tranſlation of a mans right to another; as a man that owes an horſe may paſs him over to another by ſome ſigne of his will; now becauſe by ſuch a ſigne ſome right paſſes over to another, therefore the will cannot honeſtly change it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now that a promiſe may be of force, there are four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That the promiſer be capable of promiſing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that want reaſon, as children and mad men, their promiſes are of none effect; there can be no willing without underſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the things promiſed be juſt; herein <hi>Herods</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:171178:146"/>was of no force when <hi>Herodias</hi> deſired <hi>John</hi>'s head.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That we promiſe what is in our own power. If a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant promiſe his ſervice to him that is not his maſter, this promiſe is nothing, becauſe it is beyond the power of the promiſer; ſo if a man ſhould promiſe to reach heaven, it is out of his power.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 After our promiſe is made to any perſon, upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that we look upon it as an abſolute debt, which we cannot in conſcience nullifie, unleſs the perſon to whom we promiſe do acquit us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whatſoever is more then theſe cometh of evil]</hi> Evil in the maſculine Gender ſignifies the evil ſpirit, the devil, who tempts to ſwearing as well as to other ſins, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an oath. If we take theſe words <hi>[of evil]</hi> in the Neuter Gender, then we muſt underſtand that this ſin of vain ſwearing comes of the evils that are in the hearts of men. As from, 1 Irreverence of the name of God. 2 Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, when men will not believe without an oath. 3 From a cuſtome of ſwearing wherein perſons have been bred. 4 From the cuſtome of men, in not ſtanding to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and not uſing faithfulneſs in their ſpeeches, ſo that it is as if Chriſt had ſaid, think not you will be excluded from the ſociety of men if you refrain from ſwearing, for the manner of ſwearing, ſpringing up from mens unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if you ſhall honeſtly perform your words and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, you will ſooner be believed without an oath then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with an oath.</p>
                  <p>Yet know that Chriſt doth not count oaths evil or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull in the whole, but things that are not to be uſed ſave in matters of very great moment; as bring called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Magiſtrate, or when ſomething is committed to the truſt of another, or for purging our own innocency, when ſuſpected, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.19. or when perſons are ſlow to believe that which is profitable for them to believe, or for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Ro.</hi> 9.1. Oaths are not to be uſed but in theſe and ſuch like caſes as have been named.</p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:171178:147"/>
                  <p>For Application, learn to keep vvithin the bounds of yea and nay, avoiding all prophane ſwearing. If the Princes of the world will not ſuffer their names to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, vvill God ſuffer it? Will Chriſt ſuffer his vvounds, his heart, his bloud, his foot to be ſworn by? Alſo all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane curſing, to vviſh they might ſink, be hang'd, be damn'd, be burnt, never to come in the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, never ſee vvife or children, or the face of God, that this bread may be their laſt if it be not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Moreover beware of ſwearing by creatures, as by the croſs, by light, by heaven, by faith, troth, by <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by thy head: remember vvhatſoever is above <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay</hi> is ſin.</p>
                  <p>Avoid the calling of God to witneſs in trivial things, as even many profeſſors do, uſing ſuch vvords, as the Lord knowes, God can vvitneſs vvith me. Moreover learn to be conſtant in your vvords and promiſes, that your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs may perſwade men to believe you vvithout oaths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 38. <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's another Commandement depraved by the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, vvhich vvas the law of like for like, or retaliation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.23, 24, 25. This law of giving eye for eye, tooth for tooth, vvhich vvas appropriated to the Judge, they applied it to private perſons, that every man might avenge himſelf. That it belonged to the Judges onely, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.21. the ſcope of which law vvas to keep men from aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themſelves, ſeeing they had the Magiſtrate an avenger of their vvrongs. Onely vvhere Magiſtracy cannot be had, there may be an unblameable defence. The law of the 12 Tables vvas, if he hath broken a member let there be like for like. Now the Phariſees expounded the law of God to ſerve the corrupt humours of the Jews, vvho vvere much given to private revenge; yea it is natural to every man to think revenge ſweeter then milk, then life. Corrupt teachers
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:171178:147"/>are ready to expound the law of God according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men, as Princes frame their governments according to the manners of their people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 39. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Reſiſt not evil, but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſiſt not evil]</hi> Chriſt in anſwer forbids all private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. We ſhould onely deſire to defend our ſelves and ours, not thirſt to hurt our Enemy. For that revenge that <hi>Sampſon</hi> had againſt the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> for his eyes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.28, 29. It vvas not the revenge as of a private man, but of a Magiſtrate, as appears by the aſſiſtance God gave him at that time, neither vvould <hi>Sampſon</hi> have prayed to God for aſſiſtance in any ſin. Certainly were it not lawfull to drive back force with force, the Apoſtles following Chriſt would not have carried ſwords, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.38. It is of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to defend our lives, and to turn away thoſe things that hurt, which if it vvere not, thievs and robbers vvould ſpoil honeſt men: this may be where vve cannot have defence from Magiſtrates. But to puſh like rams, as thoſe Kings, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.40. is forbid. Whereas Chriſt blamed <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 26.52. <hi>Put up thy ſword into his place, for all they that take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword,</hi> It vvas not for driving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay force by force, but for his deſire of revenge, vvhich revenge appears, in that it vvas not probable that ſuch a multitude as came to take Chriſt, ſhould be driven back by two or three armed men. Alſo Chriſt blames him for going on ſo raſhly, vvithout his command or the Magiſtrates command. He that takes away thus any mans life vvith the ſword, ſhall periſh either by mans ſword, or by the ſword of Gods vengeance.</p>
                  <p>Moreover this command of not reſiſting evil, ſeems to be a ſupplement to <hi>Moſes. Tertul. cont. Marcion l.</hi> 4. <hi>Chriſt taught us a new pattern, forbidding the courſe of wrong permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the creatour, requiring eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:171178:148"/>When he teaches vengeance is mine, I will repay it, he teaches that patience expects revenge; yea the Lord doth not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid revenge, but the remembrance and calling to minde of the wrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beware then how you uſe private revenge, vvhether it be that vvhich is inward, as the bearing of a grudge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Grudge not one againſt another,</hi> or that vvhich is outvvard, vvhen a man ſhall vent revengful vvords or actions, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.22. <hi>Say not thou I will recompenſe evil, but wait on the Lord and he ſhall ſave thee.</hi> Prov. 24 29. <hi>Say not thou I will do to him as he hath done to me, I will render to the man according to his work. Chriſt gave not reviling for reviling,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. <hi>he was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter,</hi> Eſai. 53.7. <hi>as a ſheep before the ſhearers is dumb, ſo opened he not his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other alſo]</hi> This is a proverb taken from <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.30. <hi>he giveth his cheek to him that ſmiteth him;</hi> it ſignifies to ſuffer wrongs patiently rather then revenge our ſelves This was exemplified by Chriſt, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that pluckt off the hair, I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi> Chriſt meets with an objection; if I may not revenge my ſelf, by bearing one wrong, I invite my enemy to do me another: Chriſt therefore ſaith, its better to take the ſecond wrong, then to revenge our ſelves, can preſerve us from further injuries, or elſe repair us for what we ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe this general rule of not revenging our ſelves might ſeem hard, Chriſt inſtances in 3 particulars.</p>

Yet doth not Chriſt intend patience in all ſorts of wrongs, but in light wrongs, as a box or a blow, but if it prejudice our life, we may fight with him, and rather kill then be kil'd. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22, 2. a man might lawfully kill a thief in the night without the guilt of blood, ſo we may bear the loſs of a garment, but if it prejudice our eſtate we may go to law with him, ſo to go two miles with a man if he compell thee, but not to go an hundred. By this firſt inſtance Chriſt reprehends the uſual practiſe of fighting and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, as being the acts of evil men, and not of Chriſtians, who are to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 40. <hi>And if any man will ſue thee at the Law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt gives a ſecond inſtance, wherein Chriſtian pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to ſhow it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> in bearing ſmaller wrongs done to our eſtate and property, as if a perſon by oppreſſion in law take away one garment, and then another.</p>
                  <p>The meaning is, when Chriſtians are ſpoyled of one part of their goods, they ought by patience to prepare themſelves for the ſpoil of the reſt. Chriſt means not as if we might not come to ſue at law for the juſt defence of our eſtates; few indeed ſue in courts of juſtice with a patient ſpirit, yet becauſe ſome do ſo, we muſt not condemn going to law, till impatience do appear, and ſeeing the cloak is more worth then the coat, Chriſt ſignifies, that when we receive a leſs loſs, we ſhould prepare for a greater: in ſumme Chriſt forbids ſcandalous and impatient going to law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>ad</hi> 8. <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Caeſar. Zenas</hi> a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer is reckoned among believers. We ſhould alſo learn to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:171178:149"/>preferre our peace before our goods, and to be ſlow in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to law, in that its apt to diſquiet the mind. An ounce of peace is worth a pound of victory; Law ſhould be uſed as deſperate Phyſick, onely in caſe of extremity.</p>

                  <p>Here's a third caſe wherein Chriſtian patience is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>viz.</hi> in loſs of liberty, which is when a man ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell thee to go with him a mile: as in theſe dayes they will preſs poſt-horſes for the ſervice of the ſtate, ſo were they wont to preſs perſons for the ſervice of the Emperor. <gap reason="foreign">

As it is a ſign of a vveak ſtomach not to digeſt hard meat, ſo its a ſign of a weak mind not to digeſt a hard word.

                     <hi>Give to him that asketh thee]</hi> Chriſt next to the duty of Forgiving touches upon the duty of Giving. Chriſt his purpoſe is not to make us prodigal, (as we muſt needs be if we give to every one that asks us) but liberal, and that we think it not enough to help ſome few with our Charity, but we ſhould do good to all ſo far as our Charity will reach, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Do good to all,</hi> yea to ſuch as cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite us, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.33. <hi>Luke</hi> 14 12, 13. Hence <hi>Luke</hi> 6.30. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Give to every man that asketh of thee.</hi> Inſtead of giving like injury for like, I appoint the Law of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Bounty, though it were ſuch an one as formerly had ſtruck thee on the cheek, and ſued thee at the Law, yet
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:171178:150"/>coming to want, relieve him. Do not thou, for Wrongs and Injuries he hath done to thee, <hi>Turn away</hi> thy face from him. This word <hi>Turn not away,</hi> and thoſe words <hi>Luke</hi> 6.30. <hi>He that taketh away thy Goods ask them not again,</hi> which are joyned with this Command, <hi>Give to every one that asketh of thee,</hi> ſhew, that this is the meaning, that in ſtead of Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Injuries, Chriſtians ſhould retaliate Benefits, as giving and lending, for Chriſt ſpeaks of one who hath done the Wrong, and like a Thief hath taken away thy Goods.</p>
                  <p>Not that Chriſt means that we ſhould give to every man that asks, for then ſhould we have nothing for our ſelves, but let our Charity be according to our ability. Alms is compared to Seed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. and Seed uſes not to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly ſcattered, but to be ſowen with diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we exempted from this duty till perſons ask us, for we being able, are to inquire for objects to be relieved. As <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> ſought out <hi>Paul</hi> very diligently at <hi>Rome,</hi> knowing him to be in want, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                  <p>Now in performing the duty of giving, conſider theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 We muſt be pitifull to the poor.

                  <head>Reaſons why it is lawfull to take of rich men for lending.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe the prohibition of taking money for loan is determined onely to poor men, never to rich men. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.7, 8. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.34, 35.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From the Rule of Equity. Is it equal that a rich man ſhould uſe my money and get by it, and I get nothing? Beſides there is a burden upon the Lender, for now all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of diſpoſing his money to profit is taken away, becauſe another man, a rich man, hath borrowed his money.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 I ow the rich man no ſuch duty, and therefore, owing him nothing, I may take ſomething of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 From gratitude: we ought to be thankfull where we receive, now where's thankfulneſs if you pay back onely the principal?</p>
                  <p n="5">5 From Charity, which teaches every man to have a care of his own. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. Now if rich men have my money and grow richer by it, and I have nothing from it, where is my care?</p>
                  <p>Onely if thou haſt ſtore of money, beware that thou doſt not ſo lend out thy money to rich men for profit, that thou haſt not to ſupply the poor, where duty calls for it. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.35, 36, 37. <hi>If thy Brother be waxen poor thou ſhalt not give him thy money upon uſury.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>To theſe we are to lend freely becauſe they borrow for the ſuſtentation of the life of them and theirs, whereas rich men borrow to get gain thereby: hence rich Chriſtians

                     <hi>V.</hi> 44. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt reproves another depravation of the Phariſees, which had three Branches, 1 that they expounded Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to be onely Friend or Kinſman, whereas the Lord means all men who have a common nature with us, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.32. 2 That they left out of the Text theſe words <hi>[thy ſelf] Levit.</hi> 19.18. The Command was, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> 3 That their Enemies were to be hated, whereas the contrary appears, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.21. <hi>If thine Enemy hunger feed him. Exod.</hi> 23.4.5. If the Ox or Aſs of an Enemy were wandring they were to bring him home. Now the Scribes gathered, 1 That as the <hi>Jews</hi> lived in oppoſition to the foreign Enemies, <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Amalekites,</hi> they might alſo hate their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and perſonal Enemies. 2 That the Scribes drew this principle of hatred of Enemies from the Rule of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which was, we muſt love our Friends, therefore we muſt hate our Enemies: now a right Conſequent will not follow from Contraries, unleſs they be equal. From all this Chriſt clears the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But I ſay unto you, Love your Enemies]</hi> Chriſt ſets down,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Command, 1 Generally, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> 2 Particularly in three Branches, 1 <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you.</hi> 2 <hi>Do good to them that hate you.</hi> 3 <hi>Pray for them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Reaſons of it, 1 That you may be like God, as children to their father, <hi>v.</hi> 45. 2 From the Lords own Example, <hi>who makes his Sun to ſhine, and Rain to fall on the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:171178:155"/>juſt and on the unjuſt.</hi> 3 From the difference betwixt Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans or civil men, or ſinners, and betwixt Chriſtians. Sinners love thoſe that love them, and ſalute thoſe that ſalute them, but Chriſtians muſt love them that do not love them, and ſalute thoſe that do not reſalute them, or do it very ſlightingly.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to handle the point concerning Love to Enemies, I dare not condemn <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others, who hold Chriſt his Command to be a ſupplement to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, while he ſaith, <hi>The old Law teacheth us love to Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the new Law to love Strangers.</hi> Alſo <hi>Tertullian</hi> further, So long as the Sacrament was among <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he worthily did command mercy to brethren alone, but when he gave the ends of the earth for an inheritance and poſſeſſion to Chriſt, and the Nation began to be blotted out, as it was ſpoken by <hi>Hoſea, They that were not my people are my people, and ſhe that had not obtained mercy hath obtained mercy.</hi> From thence Chriſt extends the Law of fatherly goodneſs to all, excluding no man in mercy more than in vocation.</p>
                  <p>Many think (ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi>) from theſe words, <hi>Thou ſhalt hate thine Enemy,</hi> that they have a firm Argument to prove that all things which Chriſt ſaith were ſaid of old or by the Ancients, are not to be referred to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but to the Interpretations of the Expounders of the Law, but he thinks reſpect is had to <hi>Moſes</hi> words. The <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded to do ſome common benefits to their Enemies, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4. But if we look <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.1, 2, 3, 4. The Enemy here mentioned was one of their Brethren, he who in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> is called an Enemy, in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> is called a Brother. Beſides theſe, there were other Enemies they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſhew no mercy unto, as the <hi>Hittites, Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhites, Amorites, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.19 <hi>Thou ſhalt blot out the remembrance of</hi> Amalek <hi>from under Heaven, thou ſhalt not forget it.</hi> Yet were conditions of peace to be
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:171178:156"/>offered to them, that if they would, they might redeem their deſtruction with ſervitude, but if they refuſed the offered conditions, they were to be kild without mercy. Now there being no cauſe in Chriſts time, that the Jews ſhould alledge or pretend for their hatred of other nations, the Laws which they had againſt the ſeven nations, thoſe exceptions being taken away which God for certain cauſes had preſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, the Law of nature remained whole that every man is to love one another. I muſt confeſs I do much incline to this, in regard there were ſo many prayers in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament againſt enemies.</p>
                  <p>So that the meaning then is, the precept of <hi>Moſes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kinde dealing of the Jews with other men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not univerſally to all, but particularly to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen or fellow Jews, called the ſons of thy people, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.1. to others who were aliens and alſo enemies they were not bound to be kinde, but againſt ſome, that is the ſeven nations, they were commanded to proceed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilely, but I ſay unto you, let your kindneſs be extended to your enemies. Why both theſe interpretations may not be embraced I ſee no reaſon. That there were falſifications by the Interpreters of the Law is without doubt, in that they ſo limited <hi>neighbour</hi> to a <hi>ſon of Abraham,</hi> and left out part of the command belonging to love. And alſo the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from thoſe two places, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.4. compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.2.</p>
                  <p>And it is alſo ſafe to interpret Scripture in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſenſe. Though this ſcruple of this ſide remains, that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were commanded to be kill'd, but not to be hated, as a Judge commands a guilty perſon to be ſlain yet doth not hate him.</p>
                  <p>The words being thus expounded, we will conſider the words generally, and gather,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> It's the duty of Chriſtians to love their enemies,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From Chriſts example, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>When we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:171178:156"/>we were reconciled to God by the death of his ſon.</hi> For all the <hi>Samaritans</hi> would not give him harbour, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.53. yet he brought grace to their doors, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                  <p>Alſo from the example of Saints. How kinde was <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> to his brethren that ſold him into <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 50.20. <hi>Stephen</hi> prayed for his perſecutors, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. <hi>Jeremy</hi> did not deſire the wofull day againſt thoſe that went about to take away his life, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 17.16. How oft had <hi>David Saul</hi> in his power, yet would he not hurt him. It's related of Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> that he ſo loved his enemies, that it became a Proverb, <hi>That the readieſt way to get a good turn from him, was to do him an injury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 There may be ſome good in an enemy. His created nature is good as being from God, he hath or may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good parts in him, which if malice did not blinde us we might ſee, now goodneſs wherever it is ought to be an object of love.</p>
                  <p n="3">Thy love to thy enemy may be a mean to overcome his enmity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. As coals of fire melt hard mettals, ſo will thy kindneſs melt him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Though at preſent he may be an enemy, yet he may in time become both thy friend and Gods friend. Though now for the preſent he do thee wrong, he may come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. When a mans ways pleaſe the Lord, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. He that turned the hearts of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to lend his people their jewels, can turn thine enemies hearts. <hi>Paul</hi> once an enemy to God and his people, after converſion, a true friend to both. The Jews though at preſent <hi>enemies for your ſakes, yet are they beloved for the fathers ſake,</hi> and ſhall be friends to Chriſtianity. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Eſau</hi>'s heart was turn'd to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Gen.</hi> 33.10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The miſchiefs which come from hatred of our enemies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Hereby we do more hart to our own ſouls then our enemies can do, filling our ſouls with malicious diſtempers.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 We multiply contentions farther and farther. There's no way to overcome the evil of an enemy but by doing good to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.21. We ſhould be glad when God puts an opportunity in our hand to overcome the malice of our enemies, that we may ſee the uprightneſs of our heart herein. <hi>Miriam</hi> had ſpoken againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in a way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.1.

                  <head>Motives to this duty.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 Vengeance belongs to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.15, 19. who will revenge thy wrongs far more ſharply then thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.1. Into whoſe hands its a fearful thing to fall, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31. <hi>He that doth wrong ſhall receive for the wrong that he hath done, Col.</hi> 3.25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Conſider what an enemy thou waſt to God when he caſt his love upon thee; for all he was the party offended, and ſtood no need of thee, yet he ſought unto thee. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. thou reaſoneſt thou canſt live without thy enemy, ſo could God without thee; thou ſaieſt he hath done thee many wrongs, ſo haſt thou done to God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Either thy Enemie repents of the wrong done to thee, or not: if he do not repent of it, God will puniſh him more ſore then thou wouldeſt have him puniſhed; if he do repent of it, what Chriſtian ſpirit is there that will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it? This kept Chriſt from rendring reviling for reviling, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. why? he committed his cauſe to God, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſly. It was the praiſe of <hi>Solomon</hi> that he deſired not to have the life of his enemies, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Thou never ſuffers any wrong but God is firſt offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more offended then thou art, and takes thy wrong more heinouſly then thou thy ſelf, therefore revenge not thy ſelf, hear not that ſuggeſtion, that it argues good met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to be quick of touch.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 This is the way to overcome him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. as
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:171178:159"/>contraries do overcome one another when they draw them into their own ſimilitude, when we are drawn by provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to rage as wicked men do, then they overcome us, but when we refrain from revenge we overcome them, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. <hi>Daven.</hi> in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you]</hi> Chriſt comes in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to ſhow our love to enemies, which is, 1 <hi>by bleſsing them that curſe us,</hi> ſo <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12, <hi>being reviled we bleſs.</hi> By bleſſing he means a ſpeaking to him with kind words; when he ſpeaks curſed words to thee, do thou ſpeak kind words to him. We pray for you, and for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men that are enemies to us, that repenting with us you may not blaſpheme, and reproach him, who for his works and miracles done in his name was without blame, even Jeſus Chriſt, and believing on him may be ſaved at his glorious coming, and may not be condemned of him to fire. <hi>Juſt. Mar. cont. Triph. p.</hi> 196.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Do good to them that hate you]</hi> Second particular where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to ſhow our love to enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> in doing them good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20. <hi>Eliſha</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. when his enemies were ſmit with blindneſs, he prayes God would give them ſight, alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 22. when the king of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would have ſmote them, <hi>Eliſha</hi> would not conſent thereto, but bids that bread and water be ſet before them, and yet they were ſuch as came to take away his life. Do good then to their ſouls by endeavouring to bring them to repentance; alſo to their bodies, if you give alms to a company of poor people, not to exclude two or three, becauſe they have hurt thee, ſo lend to them; alſo do good to their poſterity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you]</hi> The third particular is to pray for enemies: when they are curſing thee, pray God to forgive them; when they are pained in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, pray God to eaſe them; when decayed in their Eſtates, pray God to ſupply them; when they are damning their ſouls, pray God to ſave them: thus <hi>David</hi> to his enemies,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:171178:160"/>
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> 35.13. and <hi>Stephen Acts</hi> 7.59. and Chriſt <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. When thy Enemy by tale-carryings, underminings, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull ſpeeches, uncharitable cenſures, and ſlanderous accuſations ſtrives to work thee out of the affections of the godly, or of thoſe who may do thee good, do thou pray for them, not that they may have ſucceſs in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, but that they may acknowledg their evils and be pardoned.</p>
                  <p>This is the excellency of a Chriſtian, to do things above nature, to pardon ſpitefull perſons: ſuch prayers are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtrumental to obtain pardon for our Enemies, as the prayers of Chriſt and <hi>Stephen</hi> did, but are arguments or evidences of Gods pardoning us. What a bleſſed thing will it be at the day of Chriſt to appear to have been a mean by thy prayers of ſaving the ſoul of a perſecuting Enemy? When <hi>David</hi>'s Enemies compaſſed him with words of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and became adverſaries to him for his love to them, he gave himſelf to prayer, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 109.3, 4, 5.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 45. <hi>That you may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth Rain on the juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt here gives Reaſons why we ſhould love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as, 1 <hi>[That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven]</hi> not that love to our Enemies is the form of our Adoption, but a demonſtration thereof, that ye may be, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. that is, that ye may be made manifeſt to be. He that performs not this duty is none of Gods children. Love to Enemies doth manifeſt our Adoption, becauſe Love to our Enemies doth flow from that Love God hath ſhewed to us when we were Enemies, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Of all duties Chriſtians ſhould be carefull to practiſe thoſe which evidence aſſurance, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.10. This duty tends thereunto. What ſhall we think of thoſe who are ſo far from loving their Enemies that they do not love their
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:171178:160"/>Friends? theſe are like the rebellious Angels who having had a bleſſed nature from God, ſet him at nought. Many have ſuch a frame of ſpirit, as <hi>Achitophel</hi> had to <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 55.12, 13. and <hi>Joas</hi> to <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.22. Many men lay aſide not onely grace but even the light of nature.</p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>that ye may be the Children of your Father,</hi> that is, like to your Father, as Children to their Father: your Father doth good to his Enemies, giving them the Sun to ſhine on them, and the Rain to fall on their Land to make it fruitfull, be ye like him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> compared with <hi>cap.</hi> 5.1, 2. He that is like another is proverbially ſaid to be his Son.</p>

                     <hi>Who maketh his Sun to riſe and his Rain to fall]</hi> All Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons refer the effects of Nature to the God of Nature; hence theſe phraſes, it rains, it thunders, that is, God rains and thunders. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.4, 5. <hi>In the Heavens hath he ſet a Tabernacle for the Sun,</hi> which is removed as a Tabernacle from place to place. <hi>The day is thine and the night is thine, thou haſt prepared the light and the Sun. Pſalm</hi> 74.16. <hi>To him that made great Lights, Pſalm</hi> 136.8, 9.</p>

                  <p>Learn, 1. To acknowledg the higheſt cauſe on whom all ſecond cauſes depend.

It's like in all the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces, and ſo in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> farmed the Cuſtoms, but they let it out to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſo this became abominable to other of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they ſhould be Inſtruments of their ſlavery, and therefore Publicans are joyned with Heathens and ſinners, and therefore as appears out of the <hi>Thalmud,</hi> they were not admitted to be Witneſſes before the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Judges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What Reward have ye] i.e.</hi> No Reward, for you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Reward from your Friends even like love, but if from faith in Gods Command you love both your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and your Friends, you may hope for a gracious Reward. <hi>Sylla</hi> boaſted that he overcame his Friends with Benefits, and his Enemies with Miſchiefs, and therefore, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life ſaith, he cruelly tore <hi>Marius;</hi> but let Chriſtians overcome Enemies with good turns. How much better did <hi>Phocion,</hi> who being condemned to death, being askt of his Friends what he would have told to his Sons anſwered, I will that he forget the Wrong the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:171178:161"/>have done to me. If Heathens did thus, what ſhould Chriſtians do?</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 47. <hi>And if ye ſalute your brethren onely, what do you more then others? Do not even the Publicans ſo?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's a fourth reaſon, becauſe ſalutations belong and ought to be performed, not onely to brethren and friends, but alſo to enemies. Under ſalutations Chriſt comprehends all ſignes of good will, as putting off the hat, embracement, asking how they do. So that the fourth reaſon is taken from the difference of Chriſtian love and that which is worldly, the one ſalutes friends onely, the other ſalutes enemies. Unleſs then your love extend to enemies, you dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing from the Publicans charity.</p>
                  <p>Theſe duties of ſalutation, as asking, <hi>Is all well?</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 9.17, 18, 19, 22. three times this ſalutation is mentioned, <hi>Is it peace?</hi> how do you all at home? Theſe duties the Jews did onely to their fellow Jews, judging all others unworthy of ſalutation: now Chriſtian religion teaches us to ſalute all, except it be thoſe who are Apoſtates from Chriſtianity. 2 Epiſt. of <hi>John, v.</hi> 10. <hi>If there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed, for he that biddeth him God ſpeed, is partaker of his evil deeds.</hi> For that command of <hi>Luke</hi> 10.4. <hi>Salute no man by the way,</hi> Chriſt means they ſhould make ſuch haſt in divulging and publiſhing the Goſpel, that they ſhould not ſpend their time in ſalutations.</p>

                  <p>Perfection is taken, 1 For the perfection of ſinceritie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Walk before me and be thou perfect.</hi> Gen. 6.9. <hi>Noah</hi> was a <hi>juſt and a perfect man in his generation, and</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah <hi>walked with God,</hi> that is, his ſincerity ſhowed it ſelf by walking with God, making God preſent with him, and himſelf preſent with God in his actings. Now this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſincerity is taken in oppoſition to hypocriſie in the reign, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Remember how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart. Luke</hi> 1.76. <hi>In holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of our life.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have an outward perfection, but they are like Apples, rotten at the core, though they look lovelily. Contrary Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Perfection is taken for univerſality of obedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.7. <hi>I will praiſe thee with uprightneſs when I ſhall have learned,</hi> not onely notionally but practically, <hi>thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</hi> Now when a man lives in a purpoſe of any ſin, or in an omiſſion of any known duty, or in an unreſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt any known evil, he is not perfect; alſo if he admit a conſtant neglect of any duty, or an ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of any ſin, he is not perfect; but when a man, though he be ſubject to infirmities, had rather dye then omit a known duty, or live in a known ſin, he is perfect, and will grow out his infirmities in time, as a ſound man wears out his ſickneſs. This perfection is called <hi>Sanctification through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>and turning to God with the whole heart, Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. There is not any thing in his ſoul the bent whereof is not from God. Now where men are not thus perfectly univerſal, ſomething or other ſteals away their heart, as riches, honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that if God and that come in competition, they leave the Lord. This univerſality of obedience is ſeen in eying every of Gods commands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. as in governing the tongue, without which we are
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:171178:162"/>not perfect, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.26. compared with <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>q.d.</hi> he is not a perfect man unleſs he look to this command of governing his tongue as well as other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Perfection is taken for ſingleneſs of heart, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. which is when a man ſingles out God from all other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he will follow God in his ways, that neither favours of great ones, contempts of multitudes, proffers of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor perſecutions of enemies, ſhall draw him off from the Lord, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Perfection is taken for ſtraightneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Mark the juſt and perfect man,</hi> or, as the word is rendred, <hi>ſtraight man.</hi> Straightneſs appears in a mans ayms and ends, as when a perſon ſhall make Gods glory, profitableneſs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and his own ſalvation to be his end. Imperfect men go in <hi>crooked paths, Pſal.</hi> 125.4. Crooked hearts and ſtraight rules to aym at God cannot meet.</p>
                  <p>For application, try your perfection of heart by four tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ſuitable to this fourfold acception of perfection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Whether are you ſincere to eye God in what you do, as in alms, prayer, and faſting? <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Gods children, though by ends creep into them, groan under them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.16, 17. 2 Their earneſt deſire is to be wholly rid of them, and where a man can do no more but will, his will is accepted for the deed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. 3 Ordinarily and uſually they look at Gods eye in what they do, and this is a bleſſed temper, belonging onely to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:171178:163"/>perfect men. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Thou herein walks after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo art bleſſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Whether doſt thou look at all Gods commands? <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> did many things, but would not part with <hi>Herodias, Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>If thou wilt walk before me, as</hi> David <hi>thy father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightneſs, to do according to all that I have commanded thee,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.4. As if he ſhould ſay, Thy heart O <hi>Solomon</hi> cannot be perfect unleſs thou obſerve all my commands. The young man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. proved his unſoundneſs, in that he would not part with all for Chriſt; in ſomething or other unſound men diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves, if not to the obſervation of others, yet to the conviction of their own hearts, if they would not want in the due trial hereof. If thy bloud riſe when thou hears a ſtranger ſwear an oath, and thou canſt hear thy Apprentice to lye and cheat, and never be moved at it, this is but a falſe fire. True obedience, as it diſputes not the comands of God, but obeys them cheerfully, ſo doth it not divide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God but obeys them equally, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When a man is not onely willing to do, but to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er any thing that God commands, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19, 17. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell all;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, If there be any enjoyment in the world that a man is not willing to part with, as to leave this pleaſant dwelling, to part with thy country, to fall out with thy near friend, to loſe the favour of this man that could prefer thee, to leave ſuch an Office or imployment as brings it in, or if there be any evil thou art not ready to ſuffer, as baniſhment, impriſonment, reproach and confiſcation of goods, thy heart is not perfect with God, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Let the buſineſs be eaſie or difficult, tell me what thou wilt have me to do.

                  <p n="4">4 Whom doeſt thou make thy end? A perfect man makes God his end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8. None of us who profeſs our ſelves to be Chriſtians lives unto himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.18. <hi>He that hath no unrighteouſneſs in him,</hi> that is to ſay, a perfect man, ſeeks the glory of him that ſent him. The Apoſtle exhorting ſervants to uprightneſs, bids them <hi>with good will do ſervice as to the Lord, Eph.</hi> 6.6, 7. and bidding maſters to be upright in their places, <hi>v.</hi> 9. he urges on this ground, <hi>Knowing they have a maſter in heaven.</hi> Alſo <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do it heartily as to the Lord and not to men.</hi> This conſideration, that I have to do with God, makes a man act uprightly, and the execution hereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares him to walk perfectly. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 5. We preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord. That is, in our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching we onely aim that the Lord may be exalted. Unſound men have God in admiration for advantage, but when they have got what they would, and are delivered from what they fear, they ſtart aſide: Contrary, ſound men have not onely a conſtant good opinion of God, but alſo make him their end in all things. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.3, 4. <hi>I will walk with a perfect heart;</hi> how doth that appear? <hi>I will ſet no wicked thing before me,</hi> that is, I will eye God, and not iniquity. Carnal men eye their credit, profit, pleaſure, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with are they moved to act, but a perfect man is moved with this, that God beholds him that this thing he doth is pleaſing to God, and that God ſees and approves it, as when he doth alms in ſecret, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be asked how I ſhall know whether Gods eye moves me to do what I do, or other ends of credit or profit?</p>
                  <p>We may know it hereby; a perfect man will do duty though other ends be taken away, he will ſuffer for a good conſcience though no praiſe but reproach accompany it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary reſpects may make a perfect man move with more chearfulneſs, but Gods eye moves the ſoul to act without any of theſe, without whoſe command the ſoul ſtands ſtill,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:171178:164"/>as the ſervant doth at the command of him who is not his maſter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As your Father which is in heaven is perfect]</hi> Perfection in God is his eſſential fulneſs of all goodneſs and vertues.</p>
                  <p>Perfection is two-fold, 1 That which is perfect in its kinde, ſo the light is perfect light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For ſelf-ſufficiency, ſo God is perfect. As the Sun hath a ſelf-ſufficiency of light in it ſelf, ſtanding no need of the Moon, or ſtars; ſo God hath a ſelf-ſufficiency in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not ſtanding need of any creature, yea he hath all the perfections of creatures in himſelf. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.25. Neither is he worſhipped as though he needed any thing, ſeeing he gives to all life, and breath and all things.</p>
                  <p>Perfection in God is an eſſential property, whereby he hath the perfections of all creatures in himſelf, from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting, and nothing is wanting to him, but he is the patern and cauſe of all perfection of nature and grace that is in the creature.</p>

                  <head>Properties of the perfection in God.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 It's independent. The creatures may be perfect in their kinde, yet they depend on ſomething elſe; as a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver though it be a perfect River, yet it ſtands need either of the fountain or of the ſea to maintain it. He ſtands not in need of Princes, of men or Angels. Though he uſe them as inſtruments, it is not becauſe he cannot act and bring about his ends without them, for he that could make the heavens and earth by the word of his mouth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. what cannot he do?</p>

                  <p n="5">5 Its an unmixed perfection.

                  <p n="6">6 Gods perfection is ſelf exiſting, the perfection of his underſtanding, that he conceives things at once and not ſucceſſively, the perfection of his will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he wills whatſoever is good at once, now the perfection of creatures is a borrowed perfection. If a man would be perfect in any thing he propounds unto himſelf a perfect pattern; the perfections of all creatures, ſun, moon, ſtars, wine, gold, pearls, are from him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>of him are all things,</hi> every creature without his influence, is as the aire without the ſun, a dark and comfortleſs body. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>By thy favour thou madeſt my mountain ſtrong, thou didſt hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Application 1 To magnifie Gods perfection: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ſervants magnifie bountifull Lords, we praiſe the ſun, not onely becauſe of its glorious ſplendor, but becauſe
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:171178:165"/>we receive of its heat and light: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>aſcribe ye great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our God,</hi> why? <hi>becauſe his work is perfect, Deut.</hi> 32.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Be content with God alone, ſeeing all perfection is in him: as we count it day when the ſun ſhines, though never a ſtarr appear, ſo ſhould we be content with God alone: the heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> had no need of the ſun or of the moon to ſhine in it, <hi>for the glory of God did enlighten it, and the lamb was the light thereof, Rev.</hi> 21.23. though the figg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree ſhould not bloſſom, and there were no fruit in the field, and the herds were cut off from the ſtall, and the vine ſhould not give her increaſe, <hi>yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, Hab.</hi> 3.16, 17. yea though thou wert in baniſhment, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, ſlavery, impriſonment, be content with God. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. when all was gone and the people ſpoke of ſtoning him, he encouraged himſelf in God, alſo <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Act.</hi> 16.25.

                  <p n="5">5 That we ſhould have a holy greatneſs of mind ariſing in us from the intereſt we have in ſuch a God of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:171178:165"/>As carnal men have a greatneſs ariſing from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, honour, learning, kindred, office, which is like the greatneſs of a ſwollen member, ariſing not from the ſtrength but weakneſs thereof; ſo Saints ſhould have a greatneſs of minde from having ſuch a perfect God for their portion. If countrey-men are puft up their wealth being enlarged, why ſhould not we be lifted up in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of ſo great a God that hath all things in his hand? <hi>Luth. in Pſalm</hi> 121. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16.5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup, thou maintaineſt my lot.</hi> It's a Metaphor from the cuſtome of dividing Inheritances, wherein every Heir hath his portion, as if he ſhould ſay, When others have lands, moneys, Princes favours for their portions, <hi>The Lord is my portion.</hi> Alſo, <hi>He is the portion of my cup,</hi> a Metaphor from the manner of banquets, wherein every one hath a cup of ſweet-meats given, ſo others have a cup of wealth, of honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but God <hi>is the portion of my cup.</hi> Such a greatneſs of minde had <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 119.96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection.</hi>

               <p>THis Chapter hath ſix parts in it, the firſt is of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hypocriſie and vain-glory, and following after ſecrecy and ſincerity in the giving of Alms.</p>
               <p>Whether this Chapter be a continued Sermon with the former is not much material.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take heed ye do not your Alms before men, to be ſeen of them]</hi> Either of the party to whom you give, that they ſhould tell of your liberality, and cry you up, or of others. Moſt men have a greater thirſt of credit than of virtue. Vain-glory and ſpiritual pride is ready to intrude into all our ſervices, unleſs we be watchfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But is it not lawfull to give Alms publickly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, we may do good every where, but we muſt not do them that we may be beheld of men, but our conſciences muſt witneſs, that if no eye were upon us we would do the ſame in ſecret, that we do publickly. God doth not turn away the eys of men from our Alms, but our heart from their eys. The Lord doth not forbid others from ſeeing our bounty, but forbids us to do it for to ſeem boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull: for in no duty more than this the heart is apt to be carried out after ſight of men. Vain-glory is like that Worm which eat up <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But do not the Commands of Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſhine forth before men,</hi> and this Command contradict?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No. Suppoſe two men, one doth Alms in ſecret, ſo that no man knows of it, no not he that receives it, he offends this Command, <hi>Let your light ſhine forth:</hi> now no man ſees his good deeds, and ſo doth invite to imitation,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:171178:166"/>others ſhall be barren, whiles they think no man doth that which God commands, and a greater mercy is done to him that hath an Example of Imitation, than to him that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Another gives Alms onely to be praiſed, he doth not offend againſt this Command, <hi>Let your works ſhine forth,</hi> but againſt this Command, <hi>Let thine Alms be in ſecret. Aug. Serm.</hi> 31. <hi>de quatuor queſtionibus,</hi> he there compares theſe to fooliſh Virgins, which did ſhine but had no Oyl, that is, no conſcience of pleaſing God in their good works. He obſerves both theſe Precepts, that doth good before men, not that others may praiſe him, but that others may imitate him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otherwiſe you have no reward of your Father which is in Heaven]</hi> That is, if you make your own praiſe your end and not God, you cannot look for any Reward, nay, in ſtead of a gracious Reward you may look for Puniſhment for your vain-glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No Reward]</hi> This word Reward doth not note an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt the Work and the Reward. <hi>Merces</hi> the <hi>Latine</hi> word, as <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith, is derived of <hi>Mereri</hi> to obtain, ſo that it ſeems to ſignifie a Gift, ſo that that Reward beſtowed on our obedience is founded on the free Promiſe of God: for elſe all our doings and ſufferings are not to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the future glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> For application, 1 Be attentive over your hearts in giving Alms.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Look upon vain-glory as that which doth unhallow your Alms, it's a ſweet Poyſon, it's the Mother of Hell, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> calls it, the Moth of Liberality. It's equal that every man have his Reward from him he labours for, now when you give to men, it's equal you have mens praiſe, it's not equal that there be a double but a ſingle Reward for one labour.</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:171178:167"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>Therefore when thou doeſt thine Alms, do not ſound a Trumpet before thee, as the Hypocrites do, in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and in the Streets, that they may have glory of men; verily I ſay unto you, They have their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sound a Trumpet]</hi> It's a Proverb, for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were wont to call the people together by a Trumpet, <hi>Num.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.15. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 81.3, 4. Though <hi>Lyra</hi> and <hi>Pareus</hi> think they called both the poor and beholders in the Synagogues and Streets where there were any concourſe of men. So that <hi>to ſound a Trumpet</hi> is a Proverb for to call the people for witneſs; theſe Phariſees pretended they onely called the poor together by ſounding a Trumpet, but the thing they intended was vain-glory, and therefore they ſought the moſt eminent places that they might have many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the Hypocrites do in the Synagogues]</hi> Chriſt alludes to the calling together on the Stage, for the people is called together with a Trumpet to behold the Play, for in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Writers Hypocrites are called Stage-players, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>à ſimulando,</hi> from the counterfeit perſon they bear; ſo theſe Phariſees pretended to be the Servants of God, when indeed they were the Servants of vain-glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verily I ſay to you, they have their Reward]</hi> That is, Praiſe with men not with God. <hi>Chemnicius</hi> thinks it was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome that the poor in <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not beg from door to door, but that the poor of every place at ſet times were called together into a certain place by the ſound of a Trumpet, that they might receive Alms, either out of the Tithes of the poor, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.28. or other Alms of charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minded people: this appointment had ſome reaſon in it, 1 That wandring Beggars might not by their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity get away Alms from others, and the true poor be neglected, and this was done in the Synagogue where the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:171178:167"/>Law and Prophets were read, that both the Givers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers might be warned of their duty. Chriſt doth not blame this cuſtome, but the Phariſees would not give their Alms in common but by themſelves, and when they did it they would have a Trumpet ſounded when they went through the City to the place of Alms, hence they had the praiſe of men for reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>But, when thou doeſt Alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words are a Proverb, that is, If thy left hand had eys it might not ſee the Charity which the right hand doth, though the left hand be moſt ſerviceable to the right hand of all the members. Hereby Chriſt would have us content with the teſtimony of Gods eye, we muſt be ſo far from publiſhing our Alms to others that we muſt do what we can to keep it from our ſelves, that we do not applaud it, or wonder at it, or feed our eys or mindes with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of it, neither of the quantity given, nor manner of giving, nor perſons to whom it is given. The righteous ſay, <hi>Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungry and fed thee, and thirſty and gave thee drink? Matth.</hi> 25.37. <hi>He that giveth let him do it with ſimplicity, Rom.</hi> 12.8. This will be a means to prevent pride and upbraiding of the poor, and enſlaving the poor to us, whom we are apt to think we have obliged to us by our benefits. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> interprets the left hand the carnal deſire of the minde, the right hand the ſpiritual love of the minde. If a man out of pure love to God give Alms, here the left knows not what the right hand doth; but if a man in giving Alms ſeek for profit, he mingles the conſcience of his left hand with the works of his right hand. <hi>Aug. Serm.</hi> 31. <hi>de quatuor queſtionibus.</hi>

                  <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>That thine Alms may be in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret himſelf ſhall reward thee openly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thine Alms may be in ſecret] i.e.</hi> Removed from the eys of men, and done to God. If ſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt have praiſe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:171178:168"/>before men, Chriſt and Angels in the day of judgement, Matth.</hi> 25.34, 35, 36. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, it's enough to have God a witneſs, who will one day recompence it, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.14. and acknowledge it. Here the hypocrite hath ſome hundreds looking on, in the day of Chriſt thou ſhalt have millions beholding.</p>
               <p>Not as if always ſecrecy of place were required, for ſometimes we give in publick, either to ſtir up others by our example, or to relieve a poor perſon we meet in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen place; but here our hearts ought to be removed from the eys of men, and there is more occaſions of vain-glory by giving in publick then in ſecret.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thy father which ſeeth in ſecret himſelf ſhall reward thee openly]</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Though there be no witneſs nor rewarder among men, yet do not think thou haſt loſt thy labour, though men bury thy alms in forgetfulneſs or unthankfulneſs, yet God beholds thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. he looks on thy heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Openly]</hi> Not in a corner, or before a few witneſſes, or the inhabitants of one City or Country, but before the whole world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Thou ſhalt be recompenſed at the reſurrection of the juſt, Luk.</hi> 14.14.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 Gods people have upon extraordinary occaſions uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally uſed long prayer, as <hi>Solomon</hi> at the conſecration of the temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. ſo when under agonies and great troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.1. the overwhelmed ſoul powres out his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, it comes like a flood, ſo when the ſpirit comes to viſit the ſoul with enlargement, the ſoul in this caſe is wont to pray long, and loth to let the Lord go, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.26. when we have the breathings of the ſpirit upon our hearts, its not our wiſdom to give out, <hi>Longa hora, brevis mora, Bern.</hi> God's long a coming and his tarryings are not long. Shall we be watchful for winde, and tyde, and ſhall we not take the gales of the ſpirit? moreover afflictions are wont to awake the ſoul, hence the ſoul being awakened prayes with more earneſtneſs and length: <hi>Jacob</hi> when he feared death and deſtruction from <hi>Eſau,</hi> he cryed to God all night long, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. when the Church is in hazard of ruine alſo, ſo <hi>Heſter</hi> and the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.5.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 As there may be occaſion of long prayer, ſo may there be occaſion for ſhort prayer, as in ejaculatory prayer, alſo when we have but little time, alſo when ſome prevailing buſineſs falls in which cannot be diſpenſed with, onely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in pay the Lord another time for the time thou haſt taken from him.

Sometimes we want vital ſpirits, in theſe caſes we may be ſhort. And it's wiſedome uſually ſo to pray with ſick perſons, that they may not lay aſide at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, nor be weary of the duty. Alſo in the cloſing of Church exerciſes when much time hath been before ſpent in prayer.

Our prayers are not heard for any excellency in them but for Chriſt's ſake. When a Servant comes for Wares in his own name, the Merchant will not deliver them, but if he bring a Ticket from his Maſter, the Merchant will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver what Wares the Servant asks for: ſo when the ſoul comes in its own name it ſpeeds not, but if it come in the name of Chriſt it ſpeeds. It's an Argument we come in Chriſt's Name, when we come with a reverend boldneſs and confidence, but when we are doubting, timorous and fearfull, it's a ſign we come in our own names. Chriſt hath a golden Cenſer, wherein is much Incenſe which he offers with the prayers of all Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8 3. as the high Prieſt of old did, who put Incenſe on his Cenſer when he made an atonement for the people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.46.</p>

                  <p>How many worldly wiſe men are there, that might they have a world to continue one quarter of an hour in ripping up their hearts in conceived prayer, they were not able to do it? Some ſhort wiſhes they have, as, God be thanked for his bleſſings, God ſend us rain.</p>
                  <p>Others there are who have learnt the art of prayer or the gift, but they have not the grace of prayer, they pray arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial prayers, and give artificial life to them, as if the ſpirit accompanied them, but in the mean time their hearts are neither warmed nor melted.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe prayers wherein God delights are ſtir'd up by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Praying with all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in the ſpirit.</hi> Without this ſpirit we may ſpeak of God, but not unto God; indeed the beſt of our prayers are but as the ſtammering voices of infants begging bread or meat at the Table, yet theſe chatterings or ſtammerings coming from the ſpirit, he that ſearcheth the heart muſt needs know what they mean, becauſe he maketh interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Saints, now he intercedes not by way of merit, as Chriſt doth, nor by way of ſupplication, but by ſtirring us up to cry to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27.</p>
                  <p>Do the bowels of a father yern towards an infant, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and panting and unable to tell where his pain is, and will not God be moved with the ſighs and groans of his children? When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake never a word, yet he is ſaid to <hi>cry to God, Exo.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Hanna</hi>'s voice was not heard, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. yet ſhe is ſaid to <hi>powr out her heart, v.</hi> 15. the ſighs of the godly are as ſo many beams of the ſpirit, which ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:171178:179"/>cannot hinder from aſcending heaven though they ſhould cut out their tongues. <hi>Aſaph</hi> groaned when he could not ſpeak, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.4.</p>
                  <p>Now that this praying with ſighs and groans comes from the ſpirit appears, becauſe when the ſpirit ceaſes from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon our hearts we become dull and heavie, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the dutie, that it becomes a very penance to us, the ſoul then is like a becalmed ſhip. All Saints that pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, even <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, pray by this ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. By this ſpirit we preſent ſuch ſighs as cannot be expreſſed, and utter ſuch words as are not able to be repeated. The ſighings of the needy God hears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.5.</p>
                  <p>Now though carnal men ſometimes groan and that to God, yet are theſe groans a fruit of nature, as the bruits do, under feeling of a preſſing weight: the groans of ſaints come not onely from feeling of pain, but from ſorrow for ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The groans in Saints lifts up their hearts to heaven, and brings back chearing and ſence of Gods love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There's uſually a ſweet ſatisfaction comes in thoſe groans, which doth not in the groans of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that have this ſpirit of prayer they have many eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations amidſt their callings. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when he was ſpeaking to the King prayed to the God of heaven, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.4. they frequently dart out many broken ſighs to quench the ſprowtings of luſt, as pride, unclean deſires, revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have many inviſible ſpringings of heart upon the receipt of bleſſings on themſelves or others. Many zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous wraſtlings for removal of corruptions and ſupply of grace. To powr out the ſoul out of ſenſe of ſpiritual wants in that form or phraſe which groanings and meltings of the ſpirit doth indite and frame, is beyond the ordinary reach of unregeneration. Yea thus to pray is the hardeſt of all works, becauſe it cannot be effected without the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>This ſpirit of prayer is of more worth then the world, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when a Chriſtian hath by any ſcandalous ſin, or
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:171178:179"/>relapſe, or ſin againſt conſcience turn'd away Gods favour, for hereby he hath reſtitution into Gods favour, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Gods countenance, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.4, 7.</p>
                  <p>Infinite more fruits the ſpirit of prayer works, as many ſecret exultations and rejoycings, ſpiritual raviſhments, ſtrong though ſilent cries, paſſionate meltings, unutterable groans, zealous longings, which are riddles to prophane men, but known to the children of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the perſon muſt be righteous. <hi>Hear my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for I am holy, Pſal.</hi> 86.2. <hi>The prayer of the wicked is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 15.8. A holy man may make a carnal prayer, as when the fleſh gets the upper hand, but a carnal man cannot make a ſpiritual prayer, I mean a prayer prevailing for ſpiritual things, <hi>Jon.</hi> 9.31. God heareth not ſinners, but if any man be a doer of his will him he hears. <hi>The righteous cry and the Lord heareth, and delivereth him out of all his troubles, Pſal.</hi> 34.15. <hi>The prayer of a righteous man avails much, Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in you, ye ſhall ask what you will, and it ſhall be done unto you,</hi> Joh. 15.7, 8. <hi>Whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe we keep his Commandements, and do thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.22. The ſpirit of prayer is called the ſpirit of grace, if thou haſt not the ſpirit of grace thou canſt not pray, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. yet know the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of a perſon may conſiſt with variety of paſſions, as he inſtances in <hi>Eliah,</hi> Jam. 5.17.</p>
                  <p>In all begging it's a great matter who it is that begs: if it be a ſturdy beggar we have nothing for ſuch; ſo in prayer if a wicked man pray for any ſpiritual bleſſing, ſaith God, I have nothing for you, but if it be a believer, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>be of good chear</hi> to ſuch, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.48. if thou prepare thy heart, and ſtretch out thy hands towards him, <hi>if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away,</hi> Job 11.13, 14. <hi>He will fullfil the deſire of them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 145.19.</p>
                  <p>Contrary when a man inclines to wickedneſs in his heart,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:171178:180"/>the Lord will not hear him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. The Pagans had ſo much divinity as to ſay, the gods muſt be honoured with puritie, therefore they wrote upon the doors of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Let none having a guilty conſcience enter this place. A bad conſcience can never hope well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But do not we finde wicked men in Scripture have had their praiers heard?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, when they have ſought for temporal things, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoahaz</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehu</hi> was a wicked man, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13.2. yet when the nation of Iſrael was delivered into the hands of the Syrians, <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> beſought the Lord and the Lord hearkened unto him, for he ſaw the oppreſſion of Iſrael, and the Lord gave Iſrael a Saviour, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. So <hi>Ahab</hi> ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained the removing of the judgement until his ſons daies, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 21.27, 28, 29. So when men of all ſorts are in danger by ſtorms at ſea, <hi>they cry to the Lord in their trouble and he delivereth them out of their diſtreſs, Pſal.</hi> 107.28. So priſoners that lie in irons, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and ſick men that draw near to death, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>If thou afflict a widow or fatherleſs perſon</hi> (whether godly or ungodly) <hi>I will ſurely hear their cry, Exod.</hi> 22.22, 23. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was a wicked perſon, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, yet <hi>God heard the voice of the Lad, Gen.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> ſought God in the daies of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> and as long as he ſought, the Lord God made him to proſper, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26.5. yet was he wicked, as we ſee, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.2. compared with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.4.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, God beſtowes praying abilities upon unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, therefore they may improve them: the not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon God is charged upon wicked men as their ſin, therefore the performance of it is their dutie. The Prophet proves the Jews to be under ſin, becauſe there's none ſeeks after God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2. Alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.4. wicked men are branded that they call not upon God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. they are taxed for this both Paſtours, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.21. and people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.6. and all fleſh are ſaid to come to God in
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:171178:180"/>prayer. <hi>O thou that heareſt prayer, unto thee ſhall all fleſh come, Pſal.</hi> 65.2. An unbeliever may be underpreparing grace, though he be not yet come to ſaving faith, and in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate he may have many good deſires which God may hear.</p>
                  <p>To reconcile theſe to the former ſpeeches, know that God hears wicked men in temporal things, which indeed oft is onely the cry of their cauſe not of their perſon, as he is ſaid to hear the cry of the ravens, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.9. ſo the <hi>young Lions</hi> are ſaid to <hi>ſeek their meat from God, Pſal.</hi> 104.21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what would you have us to do with our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You may bid them call upon God in the general, and if you ſpeak to them to call upon God for ſaving grace, as pardon, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> you muſt ſpeak to them as <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon Magus, Repent of this thy wickedneſſe, and pray God, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee, Act.</hi> 8.21. Firſt, he bids him repent, then pray God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what ſhould we do for joyning in prayer with others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the perſon with whom you are to eat, and who is to give thanks, be viſibly wicked, either forbear his table, or declare that you deſire liberty of conſcience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which grant you cannot partake of his meat, which doubtleſs was practiſed by the believers when they went to the unbelievers table, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27. we muſt not wound our conſciences for good chear, nor to gratifie a friend, but where no ſuch wickedneſs doth apppear, my opinion is that charity muſt carry us to judge the beſt, yet muſt we remember that this is onely a privative ſigne. Poſitive ſignes of a good man, being either Church Communion, or ſome thing that is equivalent, if you will follow conſcience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I know you muſt be content to loſe ſome fat mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells.</p>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> faith in prayer ought to be
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:171178:181"/>certain of hearing, but we muſt wait for the time when, the place where, the manner how, and the perſon by whom God will work. Now to pray in faith there is command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.22.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Faith in God, <hi>How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</hi> Rom. 10.14. And this God to be lookt on as a father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Faith in the attributes of God, as his omnipreſence, that he is every where, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 6.31. in his omniſcience that he knows all our wants, and all our hearts, <hi>hear thou in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and give to every man according to his wayes, whoſe heart thou knoweſt,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.39. in his omnipotence, thus <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> grounds his prayer, <hi>thou haſt made heaven and earth, and there's nothing too hard for thee, Jer.</hi> 32.17.4. in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.4, 5. in his all-ſufficiency. Of the object in prayer <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks as I ſuppoſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>let him ask in faith nothing wavering, for he that wavereth is like a wave of the ſea driven with the wind and toſſed, let not that man think he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord. James</hi> ſpeaks not of a partial or particular unbelief in the ſubject, but of an univerſal and total unbelief in reſpect of the object.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There muſt be faith to ſet before us the worthineſs of the Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16. and not barely his worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but alſo our union with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.7, 8. <hi>If ye abide in me ye ſhall ask what you will, and it ſhall be done unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Faith grounded on the promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49, 50, 147. <hi>remember thy word unto thy ſervant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to truſt.</hi> To pray in faith is to go as far as the promiſe goes to believe that God is a father, and being a father he will not keep any good thing from his child: A beggar never goes from an houſe keepers door, ſo long as he believes he ſhall have an alms, no more doth a believing ſoul go from the throne of grace ſo long as he believes God will hear, but if he leave off the words of prayer, he doth not leave off the ſute of prayer.</p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:171178:181"/>
                  <p>Had we a particular promiſe, as <hi>Eliah</hi> had, we were bound to believe in particular, as <hi>Eliah</hi> did, concerning the not raining for three years and ſix months.</p>
                  <p>And as faith looks on other promiſes, ſo in particular ſuch promiſes as concerns the ſouls preſent condition, ſo <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Thou ſaideſt return into thy country, and I will deal well with thee, and thou ſaideſt I will ſurely do thee good, and make thy ſeed as the ſand of the ſea, deliver me from the hand of my brother Eſau.</hi> There is ſcarce any caſe but the Scripture affords promiſes which ſpeak to that very caſe, had we wiſdom to ſtore them up as <hi>David</hi> did. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Faith grounded on former Experiments. <hi>Thou art my truſt from my youth, leave me not in old age, Pſalm</hi> 71.5, 9. When we thus pray in faith, we have a bold acceſs into the preſence of God, notwithſtanding all our unworthineſs and imperfections in prayer, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Pray with fixedneſs of ſpirit. When <hi>David</hi>'s heart was fixed on God he was ready both for prayer and praiſe. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 57.7. The ſenſe of the Lords greatneſs ſhould keep us cloſe in the duty, yet when we have done the beſt, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions will be in prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From corrupt nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From nature curb'd, as a Bird in a Cage keeps a great flutter, becauſe it's curb'd of its liberty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 From Satan, ſo he ſtood at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s right hand, at <hi>Job</hi>'s right hand. As <hi>Abraham</hi> drove away the Birds that hindered him in his ſacrificing, ſo muſt we do wandering thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 From ſluggiſhneſs. He that prays drowſily muſt needs pray diſtractedly. <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts will riſe up againſt ſuch, who cut themſelves with Knives and Lancers to make them pray more ſtrongly. When a Malefactour is at the Bar crying for his Life, will his minde be on his pleaſure and companions? The ſenſe of Gods greatneſs ſhould keep
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:171178:182"/>our hearts cloſe to him, and aw us that we rove not in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Our attention in prayer ſhould not onely be to God we call upon, and to the buſineſs we requeſt, but alſo to our hearts, that they cleave cloſe thereto.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Pray with fervency. <hi>I cry with my whole heart, Pſalm</hi> 119.145. <hi>Ye ſhall finde me, when ye ſhall ſeek me with all your heart, Jer.</hi> 29.13. Luke-warm prayers they are like luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm water that boils not out the bloud. We muſt cry mightily to God as the <hi>Ninivites, Jon.</hi> 3. <hi>Mugire ad deum, Tertul. de Poen.</hi> Our prayers avail not unleſs fervent, <hi>James</hi> 5.16. Neither is a natural fervency ſufficient, which is in every creature when it is pinched, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.14. <hi>They howled unto God for Corn and Wine, yet ſaith God, They cried not to me.</hi> But ſpiritual fervency is that, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires be ſharpened after holineſs and communion with God.</p>
                  <p>Oppoſite to this are thoſe cold, lazy prayers, yawning prayers, when perſons pray half aſleep half awake; he had need be deeply awake that prays; as a Beggar when he begs is all awake, head, hands and feet; hence <hi>Deborah</hi> when ſhe was going to praiſe God, ſaith, <hi>Awake, awake</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, <hi>utter a Song, Judges</hi> 5.12. How can we look God ſhould hear us when we do not hear our ſelves? Contrary <hi>Epaphras, Col.</hi> 4.12.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Pray with melting ſpirits, humiliation ariſing from the ſenſe of our own unworthineſs is a great furtherer of our prayers, as we ſee in <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. and the Prodigal, <hi>Lu.</hi> 15.21. We are too apt to applaud ourſelves and others in a devotion void of humiliation. Chriſt prayed with a melting ſpirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. ſo did <hi>Hezekiah, Iſai</hi> 38.5. and <hi>Job cap.</hi> 16.20. his eys poured out prayers and tears. <hi>David Pſalm</hi> 6.8. <hi>God heard the voice of his weeping,</hi> hence he prays <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.12. <hi>Hold not thy peace at my tears.</hi> The ſervants of God have often had this frame of heart, ſo that God not onely promiſes to lead his people with weeping
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:171178:182"/>prayers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.9. but alſo promiſes bleſſedneſs <hi>to them that weep, Luke</hi> 6.21. <hi>Ezra</hi> weeping in prayer affected the whole Congregation, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.1. ſo the ſoul over-whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prayed, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 102.9. On a day of humiliation God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of his people, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>to turn to him with weeping.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Seeing ſome naturally have an aptneſs to weep, how may we know that a ſoul weeps from a ſaving Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple?</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſome naturally have an aptneſs to weep is certain, even from natural paſſion, as ſome men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> for the death of <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 23.2. and <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſought where to weep for his Brethrens afflictions, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.30.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Afflictions are apt even to ſoften the hearts of thoſe that have no grace in them, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> though a profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſought the bleſſing carefully with tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Ambaſſadours of peace, when they ſaw the wicked carriage of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> wept bitterly, <hi>Iſai</hi> 33.7. ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> at the deſolation of <hi>Hieru ſalem</hi> wept ſore in the night, and their tears were on their cheeks, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 We have ſeen not onely groſs Hypocrites thus weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Iſhmael Jer.</hi> 41.6. who having ſlain <hi>Gedaliah</hi> and his company to get the Crown of <hi>Judah,</hi> himſelf being of the Seed royal, there coming eighty men with their cloaths rent to the Houſe of the Lord, bewailing the deſolation made by the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he feigns himſelf alſo to weep for the ſame miſery and deſtruction, that thereby he might have a better opportunity to ſlay them, ſuppoſing them to be of <hi>Gedaliah</hi>'s party, which matter through his hypocritical tears he effected, ſlaying ſeventy of them, but even profane perſons, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.10, 13. <hi>Iſai</hi> 15.2. yea, even groſs Idolaters. There were women weeping for <hi>Tammuz, Ez.</hi> 8.14. This <hi>Tammuz Hierom</hi> thinks it to be <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

                  <p n="4">4 It's poſſible for the ſoul ſometimes to be like Marble, which weeps, yet remains hard.

                  <p n="4">4 When they come from a ſaving Principle the ſoul pours them out in ſecret, as well as before men, yea much

                  <p n="7">7 When the meltings are ſaving the ſoul is troubled in the abſence of them, when it prays unrelentingly, and ſo much the more if there be any long abſence of theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed meltings.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Earneſt longings after the Lord are wont to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſaving meltings. <hi>Mine eye, mine eye, runneth down with water, becauſe the comforter that ſhould relieve my ſoul is far from me, Lam.</hi> 1.16.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Saving meltings flow from love to God. How came <hi>Mary</hi> to weep in ſuch abundance that ſhe waſhed <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s feet? why at the ſame time <hi>ſhe loved much, Luke</hi> 7.38. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>v.</hi> 47.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 When ſaving meltings come there is an holy chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs wrought in the heart, and ſadneſs removed from the countenance, as in <hi>Hanna</hi> her countenance was no more ſad, why? ſhe prayed and wept ſore, <hi>v.</hi> 10. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 18.

So though God do ſometimes anſwer his people without meltings, yet in holy perſons theſe meltings uſually are crowning anſwers and tokens of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 We may know our meltings flow from a ſaving

                  <p n="12">12 The meltings that come from God may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſcerned by the time when given, as 1 When affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are ſanctified, then the ſoul powres out it ſelf amain, <hi>Eſther,</hi> 4.3. when the kings decree came to put the Jews to death there were great weepings and wailings: ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily wicked men cry not, when God binds them, <hi>their ſpirits are bound up, Job</hi> 36.13.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 Endleſs. That for which a thing is, that is the end of a thing, now the end of prayer is to ſpeed with God, therefore he whoſe prayers ſpeed not with God, his prayers are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.

                  <p n="2">2 Fruitleſs. To what purpoſe is a Beggars begging, if he be gone before the alms be beſtowed, ſo if thou go away from the throne of grace, before the grace be given thee, thy begging is fruitleſs. The blinde man ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31. <hi>We know God hears not ſinners.</hi> How do you know that? may ſome ſay, Why, by experience, and example. A drunkard prays againſt drunkenneſs that God would heal it in him: all the world may ſee that God doth not hear his prayer, becauſe he doth not cure him, but lets him go on in his ſin. Seeſt thou a man go on in his ſin? thou mayeſt ſee God hears not his prayers. If a man lye upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and ſend for all the Phyſicians in a country to come to him, yet we know he is not cured ſo long as his deadly diſeaſe remains upon him, ſo when I ſee a mans malice, pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lye upon him, ordinarily and uſually, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his prayers, I know God hears not his prayers.</p>
                  <p>For application, ſee then that you pray perſeverantly. Imitate the woman of <hi>Cana</hi> who would take no manner

                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:171178:187"/>when holy men being compaſſed about with many cares, diſtractions and buſineſs, could not ſometimes finde fit acceſs to God on the day time, hence were forced to take part of the night: <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the thing is lawfull now, if a Chriſtian unavoidably hindered on the day time, do take part of the night for Prayer; thus <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 22.2. <hi>I cry unto thee in the night ſeaſon and am not ſilent. Pſalm</hi> 6.6. <hi>All the night make I my bed to ſwim. Pſalm</hi> 119. <hi>At midnight I will riſe to give thanks unto thee.</hi> Or if a ſoul not content with Prayer in the day time, ſhall have an impulſe to pray in the night, thus Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. <hi>Tarry ye here and watch with me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. So the godly <hi>Levites, Pſalm</hi> 134.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Under the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> there were night-watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: the Chriſtians in the Apoſtles times were compelled when they would either hear the Word publickly, or pray, to meet in the night, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.12. <hi>Peter</hi> in the night came to the houſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> where many were gathered together praying, <hi>Acts</hi> 20 7. <hi>John</hi> 20.19. Now they met in the night becauſe of the Pagans among whom they lived, to avoid their fury. Afterwards when Emperours became Chriſtians, whether for ſolemnity, cuſtome or devotion ſake, I know not, Chriſtians ſtill retained the cuſtome of wakings, and theſe Wakes they kept when a ſolemn Feaſt or Holy-day came on, which Wake they ſpent in Prayer and in the Word, that ſo they might be more fitted to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Supper of the Lord; hence <hi>Tertullian lib.</hi> 2. to his Wife, brings a Reaſon why Chriſtian women ſhould not mary heathen Husbands, even from theſe Wakes, for ſaith he, <hi>Quis Ethnicus nocturnis convocationibus, &amp;c. What Heathen would willingly endure his Wife to be from his ſide at theſe night aſſemblies? What man would endure without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that his Wife ſhould go abroad in the night at the Solemnities of</hi> Eaſter? wherein it's like they had divers Wakes. From this cuſtome have the popiſh Wakes continued in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:171178:188"/>to this day, but quite altered from their primitive inſtitution, being now onely kept as Feſtivals for the moſt horrid drunkenneſs, dancings and licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is a metaphorical watchfulneſs. This is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Againſt drowſineſs, that we do not come before the Lord with ſleepy Prayers. Thus <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> fell aſleep even as Chriſt was at Prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.40. They had a willingneſs to have watched with Chriſt, but drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſeized on them through fleſhly weakneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 41. See alſo <hi>v.</hi> 43. A ſleepy ſpirit ſcarce ſpeaks ſenſe to God in Prayer. How do you think that God ſhould hear drowſie Prayers which your ſelves do not hear? Will Gods ears be delighted with non-ſenſe? Shouldeſt thou offer ſuch blinde halt ſervices to the Prince would he accept them? <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. It's a ſhame to ſpeak what many men do in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which they have confeſſed after converſion, yea and it were well if Chriſtians were not guilty herein. If it ſo fall out with thee that thou goeſt late to Prayer, and thine eys and ſpirit prove drowſie, be humbled and be ſhort, leſt thy whole Prayer be a taking of Gods Name in vain. Make the Lord amends ſome other time when thy heart is in a better temper. Let us be like Muſicians that firſt tune their Inſtruments, and then play. Or like Mariners, who having a good Gale of Winde ſet up all Sails. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 57.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Watchfulneſs againſt diſtractions. I have before ſhowen the cauſes of them under another Head, onely Ile add that a worldly frame of ſpirit is a great cauſe of them, for when the heart comes immediately out of the World from pleaſures and worldly buſineſs, no wonder if the ſoul be full of wandering thoughts in duty. Alſo diſorderly affections of fear, joy, deſire, grief, anger, vain hopes, will be ready to interpoſe in Prayer. Beſides, a ſpirit of ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, when we do not preſs our hearts to the Prayer in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:171178:188"/>hand, will open a door for diſtractions; beſides, abundance of vain impreſſions upon the imagination, with the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of holy impreſſions there, help forward diſtraction. Beſides, many remaining luſts draw away and entice the ſoul.</p>

Yet may even Saints ſometimes pray ſo careleſly, drowſily, and diſtractedly, that they may loſe the comfort of this or that particular Prayer, as when the diſtraction ariſes from ſloth and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But if the diſtraction ariſe from Satan, bodily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, or pain, God is very pitifull in this caſe, as a father to his childe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.14.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether may not the Devil and corruption di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the ſoul in Prayer ſometimes with unſeaſonable good motions, I mean ſuch motions as are for the matter good, but not good at that time?</p>

One altogether, not by confuſion of ſubſtance, but by unity of perſon, for as the reaſonable ſoul and fleſh is one man, ſo God and man is one Chriſt, who died and roſe again, and appears at Gods right hand in our behalf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. After the union of the light with the body of the Sun, no man can ſeparate one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to call this ſeverally the Sun, and that ſeverally the light, but we call one Sun the light: ſo after the union no man will call this the Son the word of God, this the Son, to wit man, but will underſtand both to be one and the ſame, as one light and one Sun: now as one light and one Sun are two natures, one of the light and another of the body of the Sun, in like manner this Son, and Lord, and Chriſt, and Onely begotten, is one, but the natures are two, one which is above us, the other ours. <hi>Juſt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It's likely, foraſmuch as <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> ſet forth divers occaſions, that Chriſt delivered it twice; here it's ſet down to rectifie prayer from the Phariſees corruptions, there it's ſet down upon the requeſt of a certain diſciple, who ſaid, <hi>Lord, teach us to pray, as</hi> John <hi>taught his diſciples, Luke</hi> 11.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether did Chriſt preſcribe this as a rule after which our prayers are to be ſquared, or did he preſcribe it as a form that muſt be uſed and no other?</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt preſcribes it as a rule according to which our petitions are to be directed, not as a form to the continual uſe whereof we are obliged. I will not take upon me to condemn all forms, ſeeing we read of ſundry in Scripture, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. <hi>v.</hi> 1, <hi>&amp;c. Eſai</hi> 63.15. to the end of <hi>cap.</hi> 64. <hi>ult.

Yet to uſe a form doth argue thou art a very babe, who go by a form becauſe they cannot go alone, and to uſe a form, when thou art able to powr out thine own heart more and better then any form can teach thee, is to to offer to the Lord a corrupt thing, when thou haſt a male in thy flock. Thou art a very babe till thou art able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thy wants in conceived prayer: what man is there that is ſenſible of his wants that cannot declare them to man, and canſt thou not declare them to God? Chriſt hath given us this breviary of prayer as a looking-glaſs to ſee our wants.

We never read the Apoſtles uſed this prayer, but onely framed their petitions according to it, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39.</p>
                  <p>We ought then to look upon this as a pattern without which we might have wandred in our requeſts, often asking things hurtful for us, we ought then hence to draw the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our prayers.</p>

                     <item>2 It's a known will. Had God kept his minde in his own breaſt we might have pleaded for our ſelves, and might have had a cloak, <hi>John</hi> 15.22. but now we know it, therefore our ſin will be great if we do it not, <hi>John</hi> 9.41. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48.

Some duties ceaſe when we die, as prayer, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, mortification, but this duty ſtill continues for ever, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.9.

They ſhall look on the Lord as crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mourn, and in that day when there is ſuch mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which alwayes includes confeſſion of ſins in it) <hi>there is a Fountain ſet open for ſin and for uncleanneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 As to obtain pardon there muſt be the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>without ſhedding of blood there's no remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and with the blood of Chriſt the whole Church is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed,

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. ſo muſt this blood be applyed to every individual ſoul that hath the power of believing; this blood waſhes white, yet muſt there be waſhing before whiteneſs. Pardon muſt be had, not onely from bloodſhed, but from blood ſprinkled. See <hi>Eſa.</hi> 52.15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14.10.22.12.24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. Yet as the Spirit muſt beſprinkle thee, and apply this blood to thee, ſo muſt thou by faith waſh and beſprinkle thy ſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. <hi>They have waſhed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi> God hath fore-appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſt to be the propitiation for our ſins, yet is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believing, but through faith in his blood. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. Faith is the hand of the ſoul, and the ſoul by faith puts her hand into Chriſts blood, and ſo waſhes off its guilt, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. Chriſts blood is reſembled to a <hi>Fountain opened for ſin and uncleanneſs,</hi> but its not ſtanding by the Fountain, but the waſhing with the water thereof that will cleanſe, hence <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.49, 50. <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee, go in peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 To obtain pardon there muſt be repentance. As there is a faith unto life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.47. A juſtification to life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. So is there repentance unto life, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. With Gods ſprinkling clean water, there's a taking away the ſtony heart: where God gives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance he alſo gives forgiveneſs, and appoints his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to preach repentance and remiſſion of ſins toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. Some doctrines of theſe latter times ſuppoſe a forgiveneſs, not onely before repentance, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo before the ſinner was born, nay ſome go as high as to ſay from eternity, if it was ſo, to what purpoſe was it then for Chriſt to preach repentance and remiſſion together?</p>

                  <head>Reaſons why pardon follows upon repentance.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 Faith that looks on Chriſts blood ſhed for us, looks at the ſame time on its own ſin, as the cauſe of its ſhedding, and every believing ſinner is at the ſame time a repenting
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:171178:208"/>ſinner, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Thou ſayeſt thou haſt faith that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends pardon and applyes Chriſt, if thou doeſt this rightly, thy faith is a repenting and a mourning faith, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. <hi>There's a Fountain ſet open in that day,</hi> in what day? not ſimply in that day when they ſee him, but <hi>when they ſee him and mourn for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 God walks by his own rule: now Chriſt bids that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a brothers repentance we ſhould forgive him, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.3, 4. So upon our repentance God will forgive, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 From the rule of juſtice, it ſtands not with juſtice for God to forgive ſin to a man that goes on in a purpoſe of ſin, therefore at the time God gives pardon he gives repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The want of aſſurance of pardon doth greatly diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, as well as the want of pardon. Suppoſe a perſon upon believing have his pardon, yet is it but dim, he cannot lightly be aſſured of it until he do repent, upon repentance God gives the aſſurance, and ſeals it to the conſcience, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.3, 4. As the Lord takes away the filthy garments from <hi>Joſhua,</hi> ſo to <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s conſcience heſpeaks, <hi>I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſs from thee.</hi> Preachers muſt take heed, they do not preach remiſſion to faith without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of the Goſpel is, that whereas we are all dead men in <hi>Adam,</hi> remiſſion of ſins is tendered to all that do believe and repent, this is ſignified in baptiſme and the ſupper, which are ſignes on Gods part to confirme unto us his faithfulneſs in remiſſion, and ſignes on our parts to binde us to believe and repent.</p>
                  <p>We ſee in this petition, 1 who forgives, even God. He to whom a debt is own can onely forgive it, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy ſins for my own Name ſake.</hi> Others may remit the wrongs that concern themſelves, or they may remit declaratively, they are to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:171178:209"/>preach deliverance to captives, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. The ſtate of a man unpardoned is like the ſtate of a man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, as the words, ſhutting and opening, and keyes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. import: now when perſons repent, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſay to ſouls, as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin.</hi> The Lord hath done it, I onely declare it. Chriſt ſpake to his Apoſtles, <hi>whoſe ſins ye remit, they are remitted,</hi> but firſt he ſaid, <hi>receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for it is the Holy Ghoſt puts away ſin, and not you.</p>
                  <p>God onely forgives authoritatively. Chriſt gave the power of teaching to his Diſciples, but kept the power of forgiveneſs to himſelf. Now for the ground upon which pardon of ſin is founded, it is the meer mercy of God, its for his own Name ſake, the graces that are in us are not cauſes that God forgives fin to us, but evidences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for the onely groundis mercy, which is ſeen,

                  <head>Grounds of begging pardon.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 From the painfulneſs and anguiſh that is in unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſin lying on the conſcience, compared to a <hi>thorne in the fleſh,</hi> Pſ. 38.3. <hi>There's no reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſin:</hi> to a <hi>heavy burthen,</hi> Pſa. 38.4. To the <hi>breaking of the bones,</hi> Pſal. 51.12. To a <hi>Serpents ſting,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56. Yea to <hi>the ſtinging of an adder.</hi> Prov. 23.32. To a <hi>ſcorching heat. Pſal.</hi> 32.4.5. Freedom from wrath, law, ſin, death, are eaſily ſpoken, but to feel the fruit of it in agony of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to apply it to a mans ſelf, is very hard. <hi>Luth. Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>Fol.</hi> 149.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The comfort and content that is in the ſoul when ſin is pardoned; it is as if you ſhould take off a talent of lead or a heavy weight from the ſoul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> Look upon a poor debtor that ought a thouſand pound and was ready to be caſt in priſon for it, the creditor ſhall not onely forgive the debt but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the bond: how doth this cheer the debtor? ſo did Chriſt for us. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Blotting out the hand writing of ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that was againſt us, he took it out of of the way and nayled it to his Croſs,</hi> ſo that it can never be pleaded againſt us. Hence when God would comfort <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> weeping, he doth it from this ground, <hi>becauſe her ſins were forgiven,</hi> Luk. 7.38, 9, 49, 50. Matth. 9.2. To the Palſey man Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi> Eſa. 40. <hi>Comfort ye my people,</hi> but how? <hi>tell them their iniquity is pardoned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But drooping ſouls cry out; Hence I doubt my ſins are not pardoned, becauſe I have ſo little peace in my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Though comfort ariſe from pardon, yet muſt God make us to hear the voice of it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.8. <hi>Make me to hear the voice of joy and gladneſs.</hi> God makes the voice to ſpeak higher or lower as he thinks good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The more even the ſoul walks without back ſliding, the more doth the Lord ſpeak peace to the ſoul, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 85.8.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:171178:210"/>
                     <hi>The Lord will ſpeak peace unto his Saints, but let them not turn again to folly;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, If they relapſe or turn to folly, their peace will be interrupted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Obſerve whether thy conſcience ſpeak truly or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly; If thy trouble come from thy conſcience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing that thou liveſt in ſin, as <hi>Cain</hi>'s conſcience did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. this muſt needs deſtroy all comfort and peace, but if thy conſcience ſpeaks onely ſcrupulouſly in time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>David</hi>'s conſcience did, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid, I am caſt out of thy ſight.</hi> Be not diſcouraged when thou knoweſt the conſtant tenour of thy life to be holy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 According to our care of keeping our Evidences clear; ſo peace and comfort is wont to abound in the ſoul, and fears and doubts are wont to vaniſh, <hi>Iſai</hi> 48.18. <hi>O that thou hadſt hearkened to my Commandments, then had thy peace been as a River, and thy righteouſneſs as the waves of the Sea.</hi> By Righteouſneſs the Prophet ſeems to mean the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſai</hi> 32.17. <hi>The work of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs ſhall be quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 Pour out thy ſoul to the Lord in melting Prayers, for in ſuch God in wont to come in with comfort, as in <hi>Hanna,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 6.8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Conſider what it is that turns the conſcience out of its peace, and removes it, as ſometimes thou ſlighteſt Prayer.

                  <p n="3">3 The third ground to be earneſt in begging pardon of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:171178:210"/>ſin, is taken from the evils of ſin, which are, 1 Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as,
<list>
                        <item>1 Filthineſs of it, it's compared to Excrements, as to a Dogs vomit, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.22. to a menſtruous cloath, to loathſomneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.5.</item>
                        <item>2 Guiltineſs; this twinges the ſoul like ſo many Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whiles it bindes over the ſoul to puniſhment. Guilt is compared to a Dart that ſtrikes through the Liver, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.23. Guilt purſued <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.10. it's like bodily ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which will never let a man be in eaſe, till it be expelled, <hi>Iſai</hi> 48.22.</item>
                        <item>3 The weariſomneſs of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.13. what a wearineſs to be under the ſlavery of covetouſneſs, pride, uncleanneſs, and ſometimes to have contrary luſts domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering in us that the ſoul knows not which to ſatisfie?</item>
                        <item>4 The puniſhment of it both here and hereafter. Here it brings ſickneſs, poverty, diſgrace, croſſes in wives, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants, now when God forgives he forgives all. Papiſts miſtake to think that God forgives the ſin, but the ſinner muſt ſuffer the puniſhment, which is changed by Chriſt onely from an eternal to a temporary puniſhment, which muſt be ſuffered here or in Purgatory: but we ſee the contrary, the King frankly forgave all that the Debtour ought, even though they were ten thouſand Talents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.32. that is, both ſin and puniſhment. And though God chaſten his People for ſins after Pardon, as <hi>David</hi>'s childe born in Adultery died, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. alſo God forgave the Peoples ſins, but <hi>took vengeance of their Iaventions, Pſalm</hi> 99.8. yet theſe puniſhments were not ſatisfactions to divine juſtice, but cautions to themſelves and others, that whiles they ſmarted ſo bitterly for their ſins, they might not dare to commit them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32.</item>
                        <item>5 The particular evils in it, as, 1 It's the greateſt evil, becauſe if not pardoned it deprives of the greateſt good, even of God himſelf, <hi>Iſai</hi> 59.1.</item>

                  <p n="2">2 Sin is more filthy than the Devil, becauſe ſin made the Devil to be what he is, being formerly a glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Sin is the cauſe of all inward and outward troubles.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Sin turns away the good things that we have, and withholds the good things that we want. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Sin is that that takes away all the content of the ſoul, and fills the Soul with diſcontent and amazement.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The bitterneſs of ſin after commiſſion is infinitely more than the ſweetneſs thereof in and at the commiſſion of it, <hi>Job</hi> 1.20.12.13.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The ſhame of ſin, ſinners are aſhamed, as a thief is aſhamed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.26. See it in <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Ground, pardon of ſin eats out the ſlaviſh fear of death. That death which is as the king of terrours to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, <hi>Job</hi> 18.14. becomes leſs and leſs to pardoned perſons, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15 <hi>Luke</hi> 2.29. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.5, 6. <hi>Not affraid of the arrow that flies by day or night.</hi> Death to Saints is like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Lion out of which came ſweetneſs. No pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative for death can be like this, hence <hi>Job</hi> 7.21. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Why doſt thou not pardon mine iniquity? for now ſhall I ſleep in the duſt.</hi> Thou wouldſt willingly have nothing trouble thee when thou comeſt to die, O get then thy ſin pardoned and nothing then need trouble thee.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Ground, the ſuddenneſs and inexpectancy of death, by it men are taken as birds in a ſnare and fiſhes in a net, <hi>Eccleſ</hi> 4.12. Now what a fearfull thing is it then for to die in thy ſins? <hi>John</hi> 8.21, 24. It's a fearfull thing to die in a Goal, yet a man ſo dying may go to Heaven, but if he die in his ſins the ſoul goes to Hell.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Till thou gets thy ſins pardoned thou art in a curſed and wofull condition, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Conſider how dreadfull ſin unpardoned was in the conſcience of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel,</hi> ſo will it be in thy conſcience when thou comeſt to die, if it be not pardoned. I ſay, if conſcience be enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:171178:211"/>or awakened, for its poſſible for ſome men from a ſtupid and ignorant eſtate, though their ſins be unpardoned, to dye in peace, becauſe they know not their danger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.4. <hi>there are no bands in their death.</hi> Ignorance of a danger, and a deliverance from a danger breed a like confidence but not a like ſafety. A man would wonder how any ſoul that is awakened can dye in his right wits, when he knows nothing of the pardon of his ſin, ſeeing the day that he dyes he goes to Hell into utter darkneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.13.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Pardon of ſin ſweetens all other things, 1 Comforts to us. I have wife and children, and credit, &amp;c. but what are theſe without a reconciled God? what comfort hath a condemned man in friends, relations, lands, dwellings, till he get a pardon? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It ſweetens croſſes.

Suppoſe that without the in-come of the Spirit in the promiſe thou ſhouldeſt believe (which I doubt of) yet through the in-come of the Spirit in the promiſe thou mayeſt know that thou doſt believe. As the pipes of a conduit convey water hither and thither, ſo doth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the promiſe believed convey grace and comfort into our hearts. Yet ſome think that when God gives a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular promiſe, it is not to meaſure our condition by, but to uphold the ſoul in the condition of deſertion or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Wherefore hath he carried our nature into heaven and there appears for us? Why hath he given us his oath? <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. Why hath he given us the ſignes of the Covenant? Why have we ſo many commands to believing and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reproofs of unbelief? Why have we, beſides the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the promiſe with the bloud of the teſtator, the ſealing with the ſpirit of promiſe, as a pledge, a pawn and an earneſt, but onely to urge us to believe? Though we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a mans word or bond, yet upon ſufficient pawn we will deal, though the man be but weak, and ſhall we not truſt God for that for which we have ſo good a pawn as his Spirit?</p>
                  <p>And in order to this thy aſſurance of thy pardon get more and more earneſt of the Spirit. Men that deal in great matters love to get as good earneſt as they can; the fuller earneſt the more ſecurity.

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:171178:215"/>matters which other mony hath not: So ſhould we eſteem the Spirits teſtimony as ſealing us up unto the future inheritance in heaven, at which day it ſhall ceaſe to be any further an earneſt, as earneſt mony ceaſes to be earneſt when the whole ſum is paid. Mean time till we come into that glory, the Spirit though it do not always confirm us to preſent ſence, yet doth it confirm us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent experience from the former workings thereof which we have felt, as the former movings of the infant in the mothers womb confirm the mother that ſhe is with childe, though at the preſent ſhe feel no moving at all thereof.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 The Scripture bids us prove our ſelves as concerning our eſtate to God ward, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Let a man prove himſelf that he may have rejoycing in himſelf alone.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf and ſo let him eat.</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves whether you be in the faith.</hi> This bidding us ſearch our conſcience according to the rule, and the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that rejoycing followes thereon, doth denote unto us that aſſurance of remiſſion of ſins may be had. It is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to think that the Spirit ſhould bid us ſearch for that which cannot be found.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That certainty and aſſurance of ſalvation may be had, appears from the many ſignes and evidences the word of God ſets down of our being in Chriſt, of our having the Spirit of our regeneration, uprightneſs, confidence: to ſay that he that hath theſe graces is not ſure whether he have them or no is a great miſtake, for do not I know that I love
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:171178:216"/>the Lord better then any thing, that I love my brother, yea mine enemies, that I combate againſt all ſin, hunger after righteouſneſſe, that my heart cloſeth with every command of God, that I hate all ſin? do not I know that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fottable anſwers from God in prayer, when I have them? Comfortleſſe is the aſſurance of hope ariſing from humane conjecture allowed by Papiſts, and differs from Theological or divine hope ariſing from faith.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The doctrine of doubting of remiſſion of ſins, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural hoping for ſalvation is a comfortleſſe doctrine, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It kills our joy and thankfulneſs; for how can I joy in, or be thankfull to him, who, for ought I know, may damn me another day; and how can I joy in a thing which I know not whether I ſhall have or no?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This doctrine of doubting ſtuns and hinders our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in a godly courſe. How can a man have a heart to go on, when he cannot tell whether all he doth will come to any thing yea or no? The Scripture ordinarily exhorts to duty from the knowledge we have that our labour will not be in vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Be not weary in well doing, knowing in due ſeaſon you ſhall reap, if ye faint not,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. <hi>Be ye alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as you know your labour will not be in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 The doctrine of doubting muſt needs fill the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with much anguiſh and anxiety. A man that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and hath no way to eſcape but by a pardon muſt needs be in perplexity of mind till he know of his pardon, ſo muſt the ſoul needs be, that ſees its own loſt eſtate, and knows nothing of the pardon of his ſins.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 From experimental feeling; when I truſt to a perſon promiſing to give or lend me any thing, I know I truſt to him and reſt on him, for what he hath promiſed, and ſhal I by faith reſt on Chriſt and know no ſuch thing?</p>

And to this there follows, after we have gone on in believing a while, a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe of the Spirit, which is ſometimes interrupted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſealing thereof, (through remaining unbelief and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical weakneſs) ſo far as to queſtion our condition, but in ſome this ſeal of the Spirit is ſo clear and ſtrong that the ſoul queſtioneth not its eſtate in grace ever after: conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of unkindneſs to ſuch a friend ſhould much trouble us.</p>
                  <p>Now we may know this voice of the Spirit from deluſion becauſe it is given to us when the ſoul is humbled and melts in prayer, or forſakes ſome dear enjoyment for God, and it leaves behind it a holy ſelf abaſement in reſpect of our unthankfulneſs and our ill requiting the Lord, and a lifting up the head to think upon death and judgement as dayes of redemption.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then that beſides the acts of faith, which is to take Chriſt and to caſt our ſelves upon the mercy of God, there is the fruit of faith to be aſſured hereof: in order thereto the Spirit firſt gives us thoſe graces and workings which are our evidences, then helps us to feel thoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences in our ſelves, and then raiſes comfort in the ſoul upon thoſe diſcoveries.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 To be lead into temptation is an act of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he, by his providence, leads us where there are objects and occaſions of ſin, without any ſollicitation from God thereto, ſo that Gods leading into temptation is nothing elſe, but a proof whether we will ſtand in our obedience, or no. So God tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether he would part with his deareſt comfort for God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.1. of this <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.22. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. God left <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 We in this Petition deſire that if God do lead us into temptation we may not be overcome of it, nor catch'd by it. Many are like fiſhes and birds, which when a bait is ſet before them, fall to nibling at it, and ſo are enſnared in the net; for when God leaves the creature to a temptation, the creature ſins neceſſarily but voluntarily. If God take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his reſtraint and aſſiſtance, corruption boyls out and we are enſnared and taken. It's dangerous upon preſumption of our own ſtrength to deſire temptations, but rather pray againſt them, but if we cannot prevail ſo far, but that we muſt encounter with them, then that God would not leave us to be overcome of them, and Chriſt herein both warns us of our own weakneſs, and cautions us not to throw our ſelves into temptation.</p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:171178:221"/>
                  <p>Temptations are, 1 Good, when God by proving a man makes manifeſt unto him what is in his heart, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Job</hi> 23.10. 2 Evil, which is a motion to ſin, as in ſtraits to uſe unlawfull means.</p>
                  <p>There's a twofold temptation, 1 Of trial. 2 Of ſeduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Of Trial, ſo God rain'd Manna upon the people, to prove them whether they would walk in his Law or no, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt remember the way that God led thee in, to humble thee and to prove thee, and to try what was in thy heart, Deut.</hi> 8.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Of Seduction; Thus Satan tempted <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. and thus corruption tempts, <hi>Eſai</hi> 44.20. a deceived heart hath turn'd him aſide that he cannot ſay, Is there not a lye in my right hand?</p>
                  <p>The former of theſe ways both God and Satan tempts us. Gods temptations of Trial are, 1 By abſtaining, when an object is ſet before us, that may be an occaſion of ſin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will refrain from that occaſion: and ſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempted by his Miſtreſs withſtood it. <hi>Peter</hi> refuſed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> his money, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 By enduring and ſuffering, when though we be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with threatnings of baniſhment, impriſonment, loſs of goods, yet we will not violate our conſciences for the eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping any ſuch evils, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. the devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon ten days, that ye may be tried, <hi>But be thou faithfull unto death and I will give thee a crown of life, Jam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried he ſhall receive a crown of life, Heb.</hi> 11.35, 36, 37.</p>
                  <p>Now God in trying of us doth it not to better his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of us, but 1 that the luſtre of our graces may ſhine forth to others, ſo <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.12. and <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 That a man may ſee what is in his own heart, and ſo <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was tempted to ſhow his treaſures to the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:171178:221"/>of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that he might know all that was in his own heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 We know not the meaſure of our graces, nor the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our weakneſſes, till God diſcover them by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. No man is ſo good but God will let him ſometime fall into evil, for his further humbling, as we ſee in <hi>Joſiah;</hi> and no man ſo evil but God conveys goodneſs into him for his greater condemnation, <hi>Greenham grave Counſels, p.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Moreover, this trial of us ariſes from the mixture of grace and corruption in regenerate men; for the purging away the droſſe of our natures, and for more and more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the principle of grace in us, we are caſt into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of temptation. It will be our happineſs in heaven that we ſhall there have no trials, becauſe there will be nothing to purge out.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 This alſo is the end God hath in our trials, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foiled in our trials may get ground of our corruptions by our falls, as we ſee in the foils that befell <hi>David, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Peter,</hi> and others, and after we have got ground more and more to come to that meaſure of refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God would have us to come to; we may come to that ſtate of glory where there will be no fear of being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, becauſe no poſſibility of being ſinfull. Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Gods embraces, without which we ſhould not ſeek God; but theſe temptations are ſo heavie to the fleſh, that oft they force tears, <hi>Luth. Tom.</hi> 3.489.</p>
                  <p>And as God tempts for trial, ſo doth Satan, for could he know our thoughts (which are onely known to God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8 39.) he would come directly upon us, but becauſe he knowes them not, he frames his temptation according to our temperatures and inclinations; the cholerick man he tempts to wrath, the phlegmatick man to ſloth, the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly man to ſadneſs, the ſanguine to mirth and jollity. He notes our callings, and tempts us with ſutable baits, the learned man he tempts to vain-glory, the poor man to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:171178:222"/>the rich man to pride, the mighty man or prince to oppreſſion, the ſubject to tumultuouſneſs, the ſingle man to luſtfull deſires, the maried man to carking cares, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian, from by-ends in duty, to judge himſelf an hypocrite. If we do good, he tempts us to be proud of it, if we do evil he tempts us either to ſlight it, or to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged under it. Satans temptations are like the aſſaults of ſouldiers that ſtorm a City in ſeveral places at once, where he eſpies any weakneſs of defence, and though he have been once and again driven back, yet will he give a further onſet: ſometimes he aſſaults the ſenſes, ſometimes the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſometimes the underſtanding, ſometimes the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſometimes the fancy, and whenſoever he aſſaults any of theſe faculties he doth withal aſſault the will.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope of all <hi>Satans</hi> temptations is, to draw us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from our duty, as we ſee in thoſe temptations wherewith <hi>Satan</hi> aſſaulted <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3.1. and <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. and Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. and <hi>Ananias, Act.</hi> 5.3. and <hi>Judas,</hi> 13.2.</p>
                  <p>Beſides temptations ariſe from men both wicked and godly: Chriſt was tempted by <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 16.22. and from ungodly men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10. 1 by wicked examples, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. 2 by wicked perſwaſions, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.13. to <hi>ver.</hi> 22. Moreover we are tempted from our own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</p>
                  <p>Now in this petition we deſire, that God would either keep temptations from us, whether they come from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or others, or keep us from being tempted above our ſtrength, according to that promiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</p>

                  <p n="9">9 Conſider what <hi>Satan</hi> by himſelf and his inſtruments aimes at in temptations, which is, the ſurprizing of our faith: when <hi>Satan</hi> combated ſo with <hi>Job,</hi> what did he aime at? was it <hi>Jobs</hi> goods? nay, it was to make an onſet on <hi>Jobs</hi> faith. The like he did with Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. Firſt <hi>Satan</hi> tempts us to break Gods commands, and then tempts the ſoul to unbelief, as if there were no pardon for ſuch a ſinner. <hi>Satan</hi> knows if he can overcome our faith he hath taken our armour from us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. Hence ſometimes he draws ſouls away from the means of faith, if he cannot prevail ſo far, then to queſtion the truth of what is ſpoken, if he cannot prevail to this, then he ſtrives to bring
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:171178:223"/>ſouls to put off promiſes, as belonging to others and not to themſelves, and to take all comfortable places of Scripture from us in an hour of temptation.</p>
                  <p>Remember, not onely Satan is reſiſted by our ſtedfaſtneſs in the faith, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.8. but alſo Chriſt hath prayed that the Faith of Believers fail not, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.30, 31. Faith is that piece of Armour which before all others we ſhould hold, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Above all taking the Shield of Faith,</hi> by this Shield we ſhall hold out againſt all temptations ariſing from imperfection of obedience, the weight and number of our ſins, the want of outward things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Satans temptations are compared to fiery or poyſonous Darts, whoſe Poyſon lies burning in the fleſh, till they have deſtroyed a man, if they be not cured; even ſo do Satans temptations, as we ſee in <hi>Judas, Matth.</hi> 27.5. To keep off theſe Darts we muſt have a Shield, and, as they are fiery, the Shield of Faith in Chriſt, drawing ſtrength againſt them from Chriſt his Death, Reſurrection and Interceſſion.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Labour to diſcern a temptation to be a temptation, and that it is not the true ſtate of thy ſoul which Satan tells thee: he will tell thee thou haſt no grace, becauſe thy grace doth not grow to a hundred-fold, that thy Prayers are not heard, becauſe they are not every time evidenced to be heard, that thy faith fails, becauſe thou haſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times intermitted the acts thereof, though the habit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; ſometimes he pretends to releaſe thee from all thy troubles. Satan does as Fowlers, who in Froſt and Snow ſhew Meat to the Birds that they may come to their own deſtruction. So Satan endeavours to bring ſouls out of poverty by injuſtice and deceit, out of trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by ſelf-murder, out of Priſon by denying the Truth, or deceitfull diſtinguiſhing thereof. When a tempted ſoul can ſee no way of eſcape, let him ſhut his eys and anſwer nothing, but commend his cauſe to God.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Complain to God againſt them, and pray for pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:171178:224"/>and power againſt them. If you cannot pray away the ſuggeſtion, yet ſtrive to pray away the conſent and delight. Condemned men make not ſuit to the Jailour but to the Judg, ſo in temptation go not to Satan but to the Lord, in whoſe hand is the entrance, the continuance, and the iſſue of the temptation. When Satan and his meſſenger came againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> he beſought the Lord thrice, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Take heed of ſecurity; ſometimes Luſts tempt when we are ſecure, as <hi>Lot</hi> to drunkenneſs, when gone from <hi>Sodom.</hi> So doth Satan, when the Husbandmen ſlept the Enemy ſowed Tares. As in civil affairs nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a State to danger than ſecurity, as we ſee in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of divers States and Cities, ſo nothing more expoſeth the ſoul to danger than ſecurity. Security hath overcome them whom the oppoſition of temptation could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Our whole life is a temptation till we come in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, therefore be not ſecure. Travellers are in continual danger to fall into the hands of Thieves, therefore not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, ſo ſhould we. While <hi>Noah, David, Peter</hi> have through ſecurity been ſo overcome, let us fear always, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth always.</hi> It's yet a day of Battel, not of Victory; we are yet at Sea not in the Haven.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 Take heed of ſpiritual pride, which is ordinarily cured with a ſpiritual Fall. Hence the Devil prevail'd againſt <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3.5. When <hi>David</hi> grew proud of his Multitude of Subjects, he was left to fall to numbring them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. When we fall to admire our ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts or graces, we are near a Fall.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 Set againſt the motions that come from corruptions, and the ſuggeſtion that comes from Satan ſeverally and apart, before they joyn their forces together, and that you may do this take the temptation in the beginning. United Enemies become more hard to reſiſt.</p>

                  <p n="15">15 Be well informed in the methods and devices of ſin and Satan, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.

And as he hath methods ſo hath he devices, he is like a crafty man that with a Plum or a Counter will cozen a childe of all he hath. And ſo hath corruption de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; this is a little ſin, thou muſt do this or elſe thou canſt not live in the World.

                  <p n="9">9 See what a filthy nature we have which is ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us to every temptation: If God withdraw his grace we are preſently ready to fall, as the ſtaffe doth when it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of the hand that held it.

                  <p n="10">10 That as we deſire to be delivered by God from the evil of temptation, ſo it ſhould be our care not to run into provocations and occaſions. <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 39.10. though <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife tempted him from day to day, yet he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened not to lye by, or to be with her, ſo not to go into hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hanted with the devil upon any pretence of the ſtrength of our faith.

                  <p>It contains three motives or encouragements to come to God in prayer, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Thine is the Kingdome,</hi> that is, all Kingdomes are thine, the Kingdome of providence or government of the world, the Kingdome of grace and glory, as if it were ſaid, Thou, O Lord, haſt all Kingdomes in thy own hand, and therefore thou art able to give all good things to thy ſubjects, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace or glory, even all things neceſſary for ſoul and body, and to deliver them from all evils, and to bring them to eternal redemption. Under the name of Kingdome is meant the power of right.</p>
                  <p>Now the Kingdomes are Gods, 1 Proprietarily, that none can lay claim to it in this manner but himſelf, alſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Derivatively or hereditarily, ſo the Kingdoms of the world are given to carnal men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.25. and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of grace and glory to Saints; ſo Satan is called the <hi>Prince of the power of the ayr, Eph.</hi> 2.2. becauſe devils are ſuffered there to rule and tempt, and to ſpeak to our ſpirits, but yet with ſubordination to the Lords providence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The power]</hi> Here's another argument to ſtrengthen our faith in prayer, as his fatherly affection on the one hand, ſo his kingly power on the other may aſſure us that he is both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and able to grant our requeſts. There is ſuch power in God that there is nothing too hard for him: thou haſt not onely <hi>poteſtas</hi> or authority of all things as a King, but thou haſt power, that is a working power, thou alone canſt grant us theſe things and no other can grant them, thou hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, therefore we come to thee for them. Alſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thine is the power,</hi> we learn that his power is not deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from any other: the power of creation is thine, and the power of ſuſtentation of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and in particular the power whereby he ſuſtains his Church, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 29.11, 12. <hi>Thine, O Lord, is the greatneſs, and power, thou raigneſt over all, and in thy hand is power.</hi>

                  <p>The power of God is ſeen in theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In making Heaven and Earth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 124.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In that he made it without matter. Man cannot work without matter, God made the World of no matter that doth appear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In making them ſo eaſily, even by the word of his mouth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 This power in God is ſeen in raiſing up the Body of Chriſt, and the bodies of Saints, which roſe with him, and the bodies of Saints which ſhall ariſe, <hi>John</hi> 5.28. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In bringing over a ſoul to believe. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. God inclines our wills whither he willeth, having them more in his power than we our ſelves. A man may ſit under Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances all his life and not be converted if this power put not forth it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This power in God is twofold, 1 Abſolute, and that is twofold,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Independent, in that none hath power to call him to account, <hi>Job</hi> 33.13. <hi>He giveth not account of any of his matters.</hi> None hath power to ask him why he makes one crooked another ſtraight, why he calls one and paſſes by another, why he gifts one and not another, why one is a King and another a Slave, this power is authority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Infinite and unlimited, whereby God is able to do more than he doth: he never ſo puts forth his power but he could put it forth further if he pleaſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. <hi>God is able of ſtones to raiſe up children to</hi> Abraham, he hath made a World and could make more if he pleaſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.55. <hi>Thinkeſt thou not that I could have prayed to my Father, and he would have given me more than twelve Legions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is an actual power in God whereby he is able to do whatſoever he will, as to beget a Son equal to himſelf in all things, and could he not do this he were not omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, this he doth, 1 Immediately, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 115.3.
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:171178:228"/>2 Mediately, uſing the means of his own appointing.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But if there be ſuch a power in God, why do we not perceive it as we do bodily force?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe it works inviſibly, as the influence of the Heavens doth upon the bodies of men and beaſts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The brighteſt Light while it ſhineth in a thick Cloud is not beheld, ſo the power of God whiles it worketh in our weakneſs is not beheld ſo powerfull as it is in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To tax them who limit this power, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.18, 19, 20. <hi>Iſrael</hi> angred God, ſaying, <hi>Can God prepare a Table in the Wilderneſs? Can he give Bread? Can he provide Fleſh?</hi> They did not ſay, he could not, but onely queſtioned his power, <hi>They limited the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>v.</hi> 41. This was <hi>Moſes</hi> ſin, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.19. to 24. when God ſaid he would feed 600000 men with fleſh a whole moneth, he could not believe it. <hi>Martha</hi> could not believe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was able to raiſe up <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead four days, <hi>John</hi> 11.39. So when <hi>Eliſha</hi> propheſied of ſuch a plenty, next day, the Noble-man ſaid, <hi>If the Lord would make Windows in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, might this thing be?</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Information, 1 That there's nothing too hard for God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.14. <hi>He hath brought Light out of Darkneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. Good out of Evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20. Men may make good out of natural evil, as out of poyſonous Ingredients, but not out of moral evil. We are too apt to draw a ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God by our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Conſolation to Gods people, 1 In ſtraits, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.10. When <hi>Abraham</hi> was ready to ſlay <hi>Iſaac</hi> God appears to him out of Heaven and bids him hold his hand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14. When <hi>Eſau</hi> came againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gods power was ſeen in turning his heart to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 33.10. <hi>I have ſeen thy face as the face of God,</hi> that is, I have ſeen God in thy loving
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:171178:228"/>looks. So in Queen <hi>Heſters</hi> time. God ſtill puts forth his power in behalf of upright men, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9.</p>

God can make them Friends, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Terrour to wicked men that have ſuch a powerfull God againſt them. God can arm all creatures againſt thee; Worms to eat up <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12.23.

Men ſtrive to make powerfull men their Friends, make God thy Friend, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27.1. <hi>Iſai</hi> 51.12, 13. and fear to offend him. We are affraid to offend men of power, much more fear to offend this powerfull God. See a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table place, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 4.23, 24.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 He can put forth his power more in one than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he puts forth his power more in ſcalding Oyl, that it burns more ſtrongly than ſcalding Water, the Fire is more in the Oyl than in the Water, ſo the power of God is more in Saints than wicked men, more in one Saint at one time than another, more in <hi>Paul</hi> than in the reſt of the Apoſtles, more in ſome part of a duty than another part of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 His power is not tyed to means.

                  <p n="5">5 Whatſoever he doth he doth it without labour or wearineſs, <hi>Iſai</hi> 40.28. The Creatour of the ends of the Earth fainteth not, neither is weary.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt ſhows here that pardon of ſin is given and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:171178:231"/>unto us, upon the condition of repentance and new obedience, one branch whereof conſiſts in gentleneſs in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving wrongs, which men do againſt us, and ſo much more becauſe we are ready to aggravate other mens faults, as ſlow to confeſs our own; therefore that we may be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full herein Chriſt bids us ſet our own faults before our eys. Chriſtians ought greatly to endeavour after peace, that they may not offend one another, or if it fall out that they do offend one another, that they be ready to forgive.</p>
                  <p>This command doth not deſtroy the diſcipline of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies towards children and ſtubborn ſervants, nor doth it hinder Magiſtrates from puniſhing Malefactors, though in all execution of judgement gentleneſs ſhould appear, but the Lord herein would have our hearts free from revenge,<note place="margin">Deut. 19.13.</note> ſo that we ſhould never deſire juſtice of the Magiſtrate, nor of God to ſatisfie our revenge, but rather do theſe enemies good and pray for them, as Chriſt bids, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. and <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7.59, 60. and <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>Now this remiſſion of men their wrongs is not a cauſe, or price, or merit of our remiſſion at Gods hand, but a ſigne or teſtimony of our remiſſion, and in ſome ſence an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, though in other ſence a conſequent of remiſſion: it's a conſequent or an effect, becauſe we cannot forgive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man his ſins till we be warm'd with the ſence of Gods love to us in forgiveneſs, and it's an antecedent to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and renewed forgiveneſſes which we have daily through Chriſt his advocation in heaven. Chriſt doth not receive us to pardon, but on this condition, that we forgive men their offences. Men that will not forgive do what in them lies to make God implacable towards them. Our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs is not a cauſe but a condition.</p>
                  <p>That therefore we may lay aſide our revenge, Chriſt brings two reaſons,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From the profit, If we forgive, God will forgive, <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:171178:231"/>
                  <p n="2">2 From the danger or loſs. If we forgive not, neither will God forgive.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, our forgiveneſs of men is not a cauſe of Gods forgiveneſs of us but a condition, hence the words in the text are not, <hi>Becauſe</hi> you forgive men their treſpaſſes your father will forgive you, but, <hi>If</hi> you forgive men their treſpaſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But, if forgiveneſs of our brother be a condition of our forgiveneſs with God, then the merits of Chriſt are not the alone condition upon which forgiveneſs depends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a two-fold condition, 1 Antecedent, which goes before juſtification. Chriſts merits are this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. 2 Conſequent, which followes after juſtification, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or 2 there's a two-fold condition, 1 For which we are forgiven, this onely is Chriſts righteouſneſs, and thus we ſay neither repentance, reſtitution, forgiveneſs of men, nor univerſal obedience are conditions, that for theſe we do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is a condition without which, ſo Chriſt ſaith not, you ſhall live for your repentance, but, <hi>Unleſs you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you ſhall dye, Luk.</hi> 13.5. If a King offer to thee, both a poor man and his enemy, both his grace and Kingdome for a gift, requiring ſome things of thee, <hi>viz.</hi> that thou wilt be ſorry for the wrongs which thou haſt done to him, and that thou wouldeſt forgive others which have offended thee, and if thou haſt offended any one that thou ask them forgiveneſs, will you ſay that this King hath forgiven you your offences and given you this Kingdome for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts or of his meer grace? ſurely of grace. So is it in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we muſt conſider forgiveneſs two ways, 1 As it was a ſecret agreement betwixt the Trinity that Chriſt his atonement ſhould be for the ſins of ſuch and ſuch perſons: this is before our forgiveneſs. 2 There is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:171178:232"/>in our conſcience, before this our forgiveneſs may go.</p>
                  <p>But I rather incline to the firſt, that pardon of ſin is held to us upon condition of repentance; now that perſon that hath an abſolute purpoſe of revenge againſt his neighbour doth not repent, becauſe he goes on in a purpoſe of ſin, and ſo no pardon can belong to him; neither is there any true faith in any ſuch ſoul where there is a purpoſe of ſin.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here Chriſt reforms a third corruption of the Phariſees, wherein, 1 A reprehenſion of their faſting, 2 A direction to a right faſting.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt here treats not of publick faſts, but of private. <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves that ſome of the Phariſees faſted two days in a week, ſome four dayes, and did not eat any thing till the ſetting of the Sun, and then they onely fed upon hearbs or eggs: they lay hard in their beds. Now foraſmuch as they aim'd at the glory and praiſe of men herein, Chriſt doth not diſallow their faſting, but onely the vain-glory therein ſought for.</p>
                  <p>That is not faſting when a perſon out of poverty ſuffers hunger, or by reaſon of ſickneſs cannot eat, nor to refrain from fleſh is faſting. But the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>faſting,</hi> is derived of the privative particle, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>So that Chriſt condemns not faſting as a Levitical cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, being ſeveral times practiſed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.21. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. but onely taxes the ſuperſtition and hypocriſie of the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:171178:232"/>Phariſees, who did not refer faſting to its right end, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſted in it, as counting godlineſs to conſiſt in pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pining the body, and referring it to their ambitious ends, to gain an opinion of holineſs, and not to ſtir up fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in prayer, or to chaſten the fleſh.</p>

                  <p>Faſting dryes up the body, and makes men melancholick, but eating makes men ſweet and pleaſant; therefore they that would perſwade hard things to others, do not go to them faſting, but after dinner, becauſe then they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and merry, now theſe hypocritical Phariſees would put on a ſad countenance that they might ſeemto have faſted, but Chriſt warnes them to lay aſide all ſuch disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring, whether by bending their brows, hanging down their eyes, or blacking their faces, and that they would ſhow pleaſant countenances, which was a token of mirth. The word uſed for disfigure is <gap reason="foreign">

So that Chriſt his meaning is, not that on a faſting day, we ſhould carry our ſelves as on a feaſting day, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 22.12, 13. Neither means he that in private faſts we ſhould carry the matter ſo cloſely that none of the family ſhould know it, for that can hardly be, but Chriſt means that when God calls to faſting we ſhould be far from ſeeking praiſe of men herein, as if we were not at all about ſuch a buſineſs.</p>

                     <hi>But thou, when thou faſteſt, anoint thy head and waſh thy face]</hi> Againſt the Phariſees boaſting of their faſting, Chriſt ſhows that our geſtures in a private faſt are ſo to be compoſed that men may not mark us to faſt: he names theſe geſtures of anointing the head from the manner of that country, <hi>Ruth,</hi> 3, 3. <hi>Ruth</hi> anointed her ſelf when ſhe went to <hi>Boaz, Pſal.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Thou anointeſt my head with Oyl.</hi> Luk. 7.46. <hi>My head with Oyl didſt thou not anoint.</hi> Much leſs muſt we think as if faſting under the New Teſtament conſiſted in pleaſures and delights, or as if pride could not lye hid under mean apparrel.</p>
                  <p>Not as if indeed we ſhould anoint our head, but that we ſhould avoid all boaſting in faſting, and that we ſhould do as they who anoint their head, who rather hold forth mirth and gladneſs, then grief and ſadneſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope of Chriſt herein is to teach us to conceal our private faſts from men, and to approve our hearts to God in our faſting, and as all other exerciſes of devotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and us ought to be kept private, ſo ought this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly]</hi> Theſe words are a reaſon of the performance of the duty, <hi>i. e.</hi> thy Father ſees in ſecret, and will one day acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thy ſincerity. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38.3, 5.

                  <p n="2">2 As he ſees thy ſecret faſting, ſo he will reward thee openly, not by way of deſert, which is onely proper to Chriſts obedience, but he by his Spirit will in the ſincere performance of this duty ſtirre up in thee mortification of the fleſh, and affliction of the Spirit, together with a devout intention in the exerciſe of repentance, and we ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, not onely at preſent, but ſpecially at the day
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:171178:233"/>of judgement. Mean time know, God is not a debtor to thee, for thou canſt deſerve nothing at his hand, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. The ſame way that a reward is given to him that prayes, it is given to him that faſts, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is promiſed to him that prayes, <hi>of grace, not of deſert,</hi> Therefore ſo it is given to him that faſts, and that not ſimply to him that faſts, but to him that joyns prayer with his faſting.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how Chriſt reprehends the Phariſes Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical faſting, who did inſtitute their faſts as to the outward part of it, in imitation of the Fathers and holy people, who were wont to ſit on the ground, and to be covered with ſackcloth and aſhes, which were ſignes of their true ſorrow, but to the inward part, which was hearty grief for ſin, and an earneſt breathing after reconciliation, this the Phariſees altogether omitted.</p>
                  <p>From the words thus expounded,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that Gods people ought, as in other duties, ſo in faſting, to avoid corruptions, and to perform it in a right manner.</p>
                  <p>I will open, 1 The kindes, 2 The manner.</p>
                  <p>There's a twofold faſt, 1 publick, which is when Gods people meet together, either to deſire pardon for ſome great ſin committed, or to turn away judgement, as in <hi>Jezabels</hi> time they met together in reſpect of a ſuppoſed blaſphemy, ſo when the men of <hi>Ai</hi> had ſmit thirty ſix men, <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> faſted, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.6, 7.

This Mammon or wealth is ſaid to be a Lord or Maſter, not as if it were ſo by nature or in deed, but onely in the eſtimation of men, and becauſe it poſſeſſes the chief ſeat in the hearts of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded men. Not as if it were unlawful to have Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or wealth, for Chriſt bids us make to our ſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.9. But he bids we ſhould not make an Idol of it, to ſerve it as covetous men do, who ſet their hearts upon their wealth and make a God of it. <hi>Abram, Iſaac, David, Solomon,</hi> had wealth, but ſet not their hearts on it.</p>

                  <p>We may ſee what it is to ſerve Mammon, by conſidering what it is to ſerve God. To ſerve God is to acknowledg him, to reverence him as our Lord and Saviour, to obey him, to truſt in him alone, to lift him up in our hearts above all creatures and enjoyments, when he and they ſhall come in competition, to ſeek and promote his glory onely; all or moſt of this covetous and earthly men aſcribe to wealth, now God will be worſhipped alone or not at all.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas covetous men object, we can ſerve God and the World together, we can have leaſure for Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and our own gain. I confeſs I am eager to get wealth, but I will not omit the worſhip of God. To this Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters, for either he will love the one and hate the other.</hi> This Proverb means it of Maſters in the whole, as the Lawyers ſay, there cannot be two Lords or Maſters of one and the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 No man can ſerve two Maſters, that is, commanding contrary things at one and the ſame time, for elſe we may ſerve divers Maſters ſubordinate one to another, as the Council here and thoſe that derive power from them, and thoſe who derive power to them. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.12, 13. and two Maſters that are in equal power.</p>
                  <p>Beſides immoderate love of the World will alienate the heart from God, yea, getting a reign in our heart it will throw God out of government there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon] Irenaeus</hi> derives <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> of <hi>Mum,</hi> that is, a ſpot, and <hi>Hon,</hi> that is, Riches; ſo that <hi>Mammon</hi> is the ſpot of Riches, ſuch is covetouſneſs, which hides Riches up that they are eaten up of Ruſt and Moth.</p>

When we give up our ſovereign love to him, then he gives us back ſome of it that we may beſtow it upon Wives, Children, Eſtate; with this intention, that we love them ſubordinately to himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 From the abſurdity of placing God and the World in one and the ſame Throne. It's all one as to joyn light and darkneſs together, which cannot have communion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1 For information. See how far they are from Chriſtianity whoſe hearts are knit to any earthly thing more than God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Theſe earthly things thou ſo affects are not able to fill thy ſoul. God onely fills the ſoul, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Silver ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver.</hi> He ſpake like a Fool that ſaid, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry.</hi> You may as ſoon fill a Cheſt with Grace, as a Soul with Gold.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Conſider for whom God placed the affection of love in thee, was it not for himſelf? As the eye was made for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſo was our love for God. To fall in love with the World and not with God is as if a man having a beautifull, virtuous, noble and rich virgin offered him, he ſhould ſlight her and fall in love with ſome baſe and beggerly ſtrumpet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The love of the World will eat out the love of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of God.</hi> The more love to God the more remiſs about earthly things,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:171178:244"/>and the more love to earthly things, the more remiſs to God and his ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 All earthly things thou ſo affects are not the true good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Why calleſt thou me good? there is none good ſave one, that is God.</hi> Chriſt himſelf, though nearer to good than any creature, yet if men had ſet their affections on him as a creature, they had done amiſs. When worldly men ſay, who will ſhew us any good? meaning from Corn and Wine, the Prophet judging theſe not to be the true good, ſaith, <hi>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance upon me, Pſalm</hi> 4.6, 7. as if he ſhould ſay, The Lord and the light of his countenance is onely the true good.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Earthly things cannot make us happy, but God can. That God can make the ſoul happy appears, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16.11. <hi>In his preſence is fulneſs of joy. Pſalm</hi> 17.15. <hi>I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, when I awake, with thy likeneſs. Pſalm</hi> 30.5. <hi>In his favour is life. Acts</hi> 2.28. <hi>Thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</hi> Now fulneſs of joy muſt needs procure ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Now earthly things cannot make us happy. 1 They cannot free us from miſery. <hi>Belſhazzar, Dan.</hi> 5.6. for all he had wealth and honour in abundance, yet ſeeing the hand-writing he was ſtartled, his knees ſmote one againſt another. When the rich mans Barns could not hold his Corn, the Devils carried his ſoul to Hell. So the rich man <hi>Luke</hi> 16. who lived like a Gentleman yet died and went to Hell; and for temporal evils, there are ſome evils earthly things cannot turn away, as War, trouble of conſcience: ſuppoſe they turn away ſome evils, what avails it to have one evil turned away, and another as bad lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Earthly things are not proportionable: nothing fits the ear but ſounds, nothing fits the ſmell but odours, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is proportionable and fit for the ſoul ſave God. Hence God to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.1. <hi>I am thy exceeding great
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:171178:244"/>reward.</hi> Men that have the moſt of earthly things, God puts ſometimes a ſecret diſproportion betwixt them and their eſtates, that they have no comfort therein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They are not everlaſting: nothing can be called hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which is not everlaſting. Now earthly things are like a flock of birds in your backſide which on a ſuddain take wing, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.4, 5. Crowns and ſcepters are not for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.24. <hi>Riches are not for ever, and the crown doth not endure to every generation. Adonibezek, Belſhazzar,</hi> and many others have loſt their kingdoms: he that rides the multitude rides a skittiſh horſe that knows not how ſoon it may fling him. <hi>The world paſſeth away and the luſts thereof,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the word is, like a ſwift flowing river. That all earthly things are <hi>periſhing food, Joh.</hi> 6.27. appears in <hi>Hamans</hi> honour, <hi>Jobs</hi> riches and Aegypts plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, called onely <hi>pleaſures for a ſeaſon, Heb.</hi> 11.25. and ſuch are all your pleaſures and delightful acts, any of you have had in uncleanneſs, revenge and drunkenneſs, for not onely the world paſſes away but the luſts thereof, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Reprehenſion of the inordinate love, men have to the world, ſeen,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In their exceeding joy in the having of them, and their exceeding ſorrow in the loſs of them. <hi>Laban</hi> when he ſaw the bracelets and ear-rings <hi>Eleazar</hi> had put on <hi>Rebek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kahs</hi> arme, ſaith he to a ſtranger he never ſaw before, <hi>Come in thou bleſſed of the Lord, Gen.</hi> 24.30, 31. <hi>Job</hi> did not thus rejoyce in his goods, <hi>cap.</hi> 31.25. thus to rejoyce is to rejoyce in a thing of nought, <hi>Amos.</hi> 6.13. like <hi>Jonas</hi> in a gourd. We have a command for remiſſeneſs of joy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30, 31. Theſe exceſſive joys procure exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſorrows. <hi>Jobs</hi> wife having loſt her goods falls to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her husband for his uprightneſs, and provokes him to curſe God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In that they can rejoyce to ſee their children worldly,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:171178:245"/>to ſee them inclined to any other vice they are grieved at it, not for this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In their eager purſuit of earthly things. How eager was <hi>Balaam</hi> for the rewards of divination for <hi>Balaks</hi> gold? ſuch were thoſe wicked teachers, <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 11. who <hi>ran greedily after the error of Balaam:</hi> now what is this wealth men ſo run after? What is gold and ſilver but white and red earth called thick clay? <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.6. What are Diamonds but the beams of the ſun (as ſome think) incloſed in a piece of earth? What are Margarites but the excrements of ſhell-fiſhes? What is purple but the blood of a fiſh of that name called purple? What is ſilk, but onely the ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and webs of wormes? <hi>Bern. Balaam</hi> had a denial from God to curſe the people of God, yet the deſire of gold ſo tranſported him that he would make one eſſay more, to ſee whether he might curſe <hi>Iſrael, Numb.</hi> 22.10, 11, 12. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 In their penurious pinching and ſcraping, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> who made a gain of urine: hence came the proverb, <hi>ſweet is the ſmell of gain, that comes from any thing.</hi> Some call ſuch men <hi>cuminopreſtas,</hi> that is ſuch as will not give a whole cummin ſeed, but divide it in two. Theſe perſons baſely withhold from themſelves and families; <hi>There is a man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>that wanteth nothing for his ſoul of all that he deſireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, Eccleſ.</hi> 6.2. How much more do ſuch withhold from good uſes? The Lord hath need of their aſſe, but they will not let him go, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.3. The poor want their dues, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.27. but they are like unfaithful ſtewards that keep the ſervants wages in their hands.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In their multitudes of imployments above the reach of, 1 their capacity: no man in the world, his parts never ſo large, is able to go through that buſineſs which ſome one man of meaner parts hath, and retain communion with God; how then can he of mean parts retain his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion?
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:171178:245"/>Every mans ſoul is like a veſſel which being once full is able to hold no more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Above the reach of their time, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſeven lean kine did eat up the fat, ſo their time for worldly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments eats up the time due for Gods ſervice. As he is <hi>a lover of pleaſures more then a lover of God,</hi> who ſuffers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes to devour his time for holy duties; ſo he is a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who ſuffers worldly imployments ordinarily and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to hinder him from religious exerciſes. Such were the old world, and the <hi>Sodomites, Luk.</hi> 17.27, 28. <hi>They did eat and drink, they married and were given in marriage, they bought, they ſold, they builded, they planted.</hi> Why? are not all theſe things lawful? Yes, but when mens hearts are ſwallowed up of theſe, when men follow theſe with the excluſion of religious duties, as they did the preaching of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> then they become unlawful and forerunners of great hardneſs and deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Above the reach of Chriſtian liberty. The utmoſt of Chriſtian liberty is that we provide for us and ours in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to an everlaſting life, having our hearts remiſs and looſe to earthly things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 In their ſollicitous cares for living: one ſaith what ſhall I do when I am old? another ſaith, husband, what ſhall I and my five children do when you are dead? what ſhall I do in a dear year, and from hence to be ſet on work to provide exceſſively? ſome have but one child or two, yet are they as full of carking, as if they had twenty; nay ſome have never a child, yet are they more ſcraping and more full of carking cares, then many that have a charge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Uſe</hi> To diſwade us from inordinate love of earthly things.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Grounds to diſwade you.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 This inordinate love makes means of grace become fruitleſs. When the King had made his feaſt, farmes and Oxen kept the perſons invited from coming. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.18.
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:171178:246"/>when <hi>Ezekiel</hi> preached unto miracle, that <hi>his voice was as the ſound of a Muſical inſtrument, Ezek.</hi> 33.31. yet his hearers profited not by it, becauſe their hearts ran after their covetouſneſs, the thorny ground hearers brought no fruit to perfection, why? the thorns of earthly cares ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſtate of their hearts choked it, as weeds let among corn ſuck out the ſtate of the ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22. Yea worldlineſs makes men ſcoff at the Word. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.14. The Phariſees, who were covetous, heard all theſe things, and they derided him, or blew their noſes at him, as the Word ſignifies. Yea though they hear the Word, and conſent both to the truth and goodneſs of it, yet worldlineſs keeps men from cloſing with it, in the great duty of ſelf-denial, as in the young man, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. who went away, being ſorry he could not keep Chriſt and his poſſeſſions together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It makes us diſ-reliſh heaven and heavenly things, and this is a wofull frame of heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. Contraries cannot ſubſiſt together in any eminent degree in one and the ſame ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>It pierces the ſoul thorow with many ſorrows,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. pinching the poor, griping the widow and fatherleſs, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wealth unjuſtly or holding it unjuſtly, theſe pierce the ſoul as if a dagger went to a mans heart: How did <hi>Judas</hi> thirty pieces gall his conſcience? This eſpecially in an evil day, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.17. he hath much ſorrow with his ſickneſs. Such men in the day of death are like a carriers horſe, which having carried gold and ſilver all the day, is disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened of them at night, and put into the ſtable with a galled back: ſo ſhalt thou be in death disburthened of all thy gold and ſilver, and caſt into hell with a galled conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Love of the world inordinately will make us caſt off religion in time of trial. The Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. <hi>That ſome, having coveted after money, they have erred from

                     </gap>, have erred like wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſtars from the faith, and ſo <hi>Jude</hi> calls them: how difficult, nay impoſſible, is the command of ſelf-denial to a worldly heart? how would ſuch turn to any religion to ſave their eſtates, as one <hi>Ecebolius,</hi> that in the reign of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> was a Chriſtian, under <hi>Julian</hi> an heathen, under <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian</hi> a Chriſtian. God being a Chriſtians end, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever intercepts communion betwixt God and the ſoul is to be caſt off.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Inordinate love of the world expoſes a man to many luſts and tentations, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They that will be rich they fall into a ſnare and temptation,</hi> that is the ſnare of tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they will be rich, its their onely ſtudy, hence they fall into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, as ſtealing, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Achan,</hi> lying as <hi>Gehezi, Ananias, Saphira, Prov.</hi> 21.6. hence called Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, deceitful rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Every creature naturally fears the ſnare, and ſhall not we fear ſuch a condition as will inſnare the conſcience? Earthly things are compared to thick clay, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.6. As our feet are apt to ſtick in the clay, ſo are our affections on earthly things.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Theſe things thou loves ſo inordinately cannot ſtand thee in ſtead in another world. When thou comes at Chriſts Tribunal, what will it profit thee that thou haſt left ſo much for every child? or that thy children ruffle up and down in ſilk and ſatten? or that thy poſterity have ſtately houſes, rich furniture, fare deliciouſly, and have a mighty train? will this mitigate thy torments when thou art in Hell? Perhaps they drink wine every day, and thou canſt not get a drop of water to cool thy tongue. Mighteſt thou carry thy baggs, thy lands, thy all into another world, it were ſomething; but as a certain Martyr in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> time, when ſome offered her money, ſhe refuſed it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am going to a country where money will bear no price, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18, 19. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us to be <hi>ready to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:171178:247"/>willing to communicate, laying up in ſtore,</hi> or as the word is, <hi>They treaſure up unto themſelves a good foundation for time to come.</hi> Works of mercy are called a foundation, becauſe as the one is hid, ſo is the other; and as from the foundation the houſe riſes up on high, ſo from theſe good works pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from faith the crown ariſes ſo much the higher.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Thy life conſiſts not in theſe earthly things thou doeſt ſo inordinately affect, but in God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.15. Take heed and beware of covetouſneſs, for a mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of things he poſſeſſeth. Thy temporal life conſiſts not in them, for thou ſhalt not live a day the longer, becauſe thou haſt a vaſt eſtate; nor thy ſpiritual life conſiſts not in it, for what duty is it but thou mayeſt do without them. Thou ſayeſt thou canſt not ſhew mercy. Largeneſs of affection rather then large gifts ſhows what the heart is, as in the widow that caſt in two mites into the treaſury. Thy eternal life conſiſts not in them, for all the treaſures in the world will not bring a ſoul to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Nay by theſe earthly things many times life is ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially if gotten by indirect means, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. <hi>As the Partrich ſitteth upon Eggs and hatcheth them not, ſo he that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his days, and in the end ſhall die a Fool. The abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.12. Taking away ſleep they take away life, and <hi>thus are riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt, v.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>It is with worldly men, as with the Bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So the ſons of men are as buſie as Bees in ſucking earthly things, in fine death comes and takes them, and another enjoys the Honey.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, thy life and happineſs then is in God, thy
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:171178:247"/>wealth is in and from God. What is thy wealth without God, but Ruſt and Canker? Thy honour without God, but an heavy burden, which in the day of account will preſs thy ſoul? Thy eaſe without God, but a future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? <hi>Eaſe ſlays the wicked, Prov.</hi> 1.32. <hi>All the good and comfort that is in any worldly enjoyment is from God,</hi> as the light of a candle is from the fire, or as a ciſtern of water is from the fountain. He that hath God wants not any good thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. In having God we have all things, becauſe we have him that hath all things, without whom the whole World, if you had it, is like the Air without the Sun, a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, comfortleſs body: to enjoy good in any thing we muſt enjoy God: for every creature is good to us onely as God comes in with it, not otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Thou ſhalt never finde reſt in affecting earthly things inordinately. Reſt is the centre at which all intellectual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well as natural bodies, aims at; but worldly men finde no reſt.

<pb n="494" facs="tcp:171178:253"/>theſe carkings are ſo much worſe, when they are in them who have either a competency, or abundance. This doth not directly prove the reign of worldlineſs, but is a ground for the heart to ſuſpect it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Againſt theſe carkings oppoſe the care God hath for beaſts and fowls, and much more for men; he that cares for his enemies will much more care for his friends and children, if for his children when they ſought him not, much more when they ſeek him and find him.

                  <p>Here is a ſecond argument againſt worldlineſs and cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares, taken from the greater to the leſs; he that hath given the greater will give the leſs; now your Father hath given you the greater, he hath given you your life and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, therefore will he give you the leſs, which is meat and raiment.

                  <p>Here's a ſecond Argument to diſſwade from carking care, from the leſs to the greater; your Father nouriſhes the fowls, much more will he nouriſh you. <hi>Behold the fowls of the Ayre.</hi> He makes a diſtinction betwixt poultry and houſe fowls which are cared for by men, and fowls of the Ayr which are not cared for by men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.9. <hi>Job,</hi> 39.3. <hi>Luke</hi> inſtanceth in the Ravens, which men are ſo far from caring for, that they hate them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.24.

                  <p>
                     <hi>They neither ſow, nor reap, nor gather into barnes]</hi> They neither ſowing, nor reaping, are directed by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God where there is food, and they thrive more then thoſe which are nouriſhed by the care of man. Yet is this no ground to patronize idleneſs, that becauſe the fowls neither plow nor ſow, therefore we muſt not, for the proportion is not in this, that they labour not, but in this, if God take care for more baſe creatures, much more for thoſe which are more excellent.</p>
                  <p>In all likelihood the fowls making no proviſion in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſhould ſtarve in winter, yet experience teaches that they are fatter in winter then in ſummer.</p>

                  <p>Here is a third reaſon againſt carking care taken from the vanity of all ſuch carking: we by all our caring cannot adde any thing to the ſtature of our body, no more can we adde any thing to the meaſure of our eſtates which providence hath appointed us to come to.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, men through their pride are ready to aſcribe all their gettings to their care and diligence, hence Chriſt ſhows that all our care without Gods bleſſing is as vain as if a dwarf ſhould think to adde to himſelf the ſtature of a tall man. As God hath meaſured every man the meaſure of the ſtature of his body, ſo hath he meaſured to every man the ſtature and meaſure of his eſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By taking thought]</hi> Thought-taking or ſollicitude is the ſickneſs or diſquietneſs of the mind by immoderate think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Can adde to his ſtature one cubit]</hi> A cubit is the length of the arme from the bending of it to the end of the middle finger: now every man rightly formed, as ſome obſerve, is four Cubits of his own Cubits high, and four Cubits broad: if he ſtretch forth himſelf in breadth, he is as it were four ſquare, now by all his carking he is not able to adde a fifth.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 28, 29, 30. <hi>And why take ye thought for rayment? Conſider the Lillies of the field how they grow, they toyl not, neither do they ſpin, and yet I ſay unto you, that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe. Wherefore if God ſo cloth the graſs of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven, ſhall he not much more cloth you, O ye of little faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:171178:257"/>
                  <p>A fourth reaſon againſt carking, which is, God hath no leſs care of clothing us then of feeding us, therefore let us not carke. Chriſt proves it from the Lillies and flowers which are beautifully adorned, not by their own care or labour, for they neither toil nor ſpin, yet are they yearly new clad. Therefore will he much more cloath his children. If he cloath the graſs ſo, which is made to grow onely for the cattel, or for the oven or fire, or for dung, how much more will he cloath man, which is born to great things, to worſhip God, to hold forth his name, and to have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life? Note Chriſt ſpeaks not of garden Lillies and flowers, which have mans induſtry beſtowed upon them, but of field Lillies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe]</hi> Meaning when he ſat upon his Ivory Throne covered over with gold, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>Solomons</hi> glory was artificial, the rayment of Lillies and flowers was natural. Chriſt mentions <hi>Solomons</hi> garments, becauſe probably it was white and pourtrayed with Lillies, for Princes uſed to wear white garments, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.8. and for ſculpture of garments with Lillies, ſee it in <hi>Pauſanias</hi> in <hi>Eliacis, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Marcellinus, lib</hi> 14. So that Chriſt preferrs the beauty of Lillies before <hi>Solomons</hi> cloth of ſilver garments which were woven with Lillies, becauſe the one was natural and the other artificial. Art is onely natures ape, now as an ape imitates a man, but can never do actions ſo perfectly as a man, no more can art equal nature.

The growth of this ſtrong faith is like the growth of a ſtrong man, which is by degrees, after a good continuance and uſe of the means, after frequent witneſſing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, after many experiences of the truth of our own hearts to God in reſiſting pleaſing and profitable ſins, and doing painfull and coſtly duties conſtantly, and ſuch as oft we had no thanks for of men.</p>
                  <p>The leaſt degree of faith is that which makes us willing to take Chriſt notwithſtanding all croſſes, loſſes and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. Now if a man ſtand queſtioning whether he had beſt take Chriſt or no, this is not faith.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 In the difficulty of things to be believed.

                  <p n="3">3 In reſpect of means, when a man hath but little means and yet believes much: ſo the Centurion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.10. and <hi>Nathaniel John</hi> 1.48.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 In reſpect of things revealed. The Apoſtles when Chriſt was on earth had a degree of faith, but when Chriſt was aſcended, they grew to an higher, not onely becauſe the habit was then more increaſed, but becauſe the revelations and objects were more.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Exhortation to grow from a weak faith to a ſtrong. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> firſt came to Chriſt ſecretly, after witneſſed truth openly. The leaſt degree of Faith is Faith, as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle man is a man as well as the greateſt; a little water is water as well as the Ocean; the leaſt bud drawes ſap from the root, as well as the greateſt branch, ſo doth weak Faith as well as ſtrong draw ſap from Chriſt. It's not the ſtrength of Faith that ſaves, but the truth of it, nor the weakneſs of Faith that damns, but the want of it. We
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:171178:260"/>are not ſaved by the worth or quantity of our Faith, but by Chriſt who is laid hold upon by a weak Faith as well as a ſtrong. All that looked on the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> were heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet ſome lookt with a ſtrong eye, ſome with a weak, in like manner do we behold Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15, 16.</p>

                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> But if a little Faith be ſo good; what matters it for a great?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though none are rejected for it, yet ſome are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. It's a blemiſh to have little faith after great means. A weak faith gets to Heaven, but it's with difficulty, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if God ſend great trials. Two men go up an hill, one of them in a Conſumption goes up pantingly, the other without panting; two ſhips come into a haven, one tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and weather-beaten ready to ſink, the other with full ſail: ſo weak faith brings to Heaven, but with many doubts and fears. Beſides, we may have greater tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than yet we have had, even fiery trials. What then will a weak faith do? Finally, the more we grow in faith the more we ſhall grow in peace and joy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. and have a fuller audience in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Uſe.</hi> Labour after a ſtrong faith. Weak faith is a precious Jewel, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.7. but ſtrong faith carries a man through the World as a Conquerour.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether may not a man of great faith ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline that his faith may become weak?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> As ſome of weak have become ſtrong, ſo ſome of ſtrong have become weak, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34. <hi>Aſa</hi> had a great faith that he feared not a Million of <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> yet after became weak. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7, 8. yea, ſo weak that we might queſtion his grace, did not the Scripture ſay, <hi>His heart was perfect with God all his days,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.14. This is cauſed, partly from want of the means of grace, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe of them, as want of Preaching, Prayer and good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Shut up a ſtrong man from food and diet him thus, and his ſtrength will decay. Partly from falling into ſome ſin againſt conſcience, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.10, 11. or a frequent gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to ones daily corruptions without lamenting and reforming of them, and partly from love of the World and multitude of worldly buſineſſes; hence many who have ſhewn much forwardneſs in their youth, have decayed in their affections to the Lord and to his people.</p>

                  <p>Here is a fifth argument againſt earthly ſollicitude, or
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:171178:261"/>carking, becauſe this inordinate carking for meat, drink, and apparel is proper to heathens, which are ignorant of God and his providence, and not to Chriſtians who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and experience both. The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which ſignifies a certain vehement deſire. As ye my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples differ in your profeſſion from the Gentiles, ſee that ye differ alſo in your practice; they are ſtill carking what they ſhall eat, drink, put on, but let your queſtions be, how ſhall we live for ever? Few of the heathens look for any happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after death, and therefore no wonder they are ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after the things of this life; but you are born to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, and called out from them, therefore though you have great charge, and perhaps but little means to maintain them, though you have now and then a croſs in the world, do not you diſtruſtfully ſay, as they ſay, <hi>What ſhall we eat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things]</hi> This is a ſixth argument againſt earthly ſollicitude, taken from Gods fatherly care of you; he knowes what your means and charge is, what the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the times; the contingent charges that befall you; he is a Father, and therefore will not neglect his children, an heavenly Father, and therefore will give you the beſt of bleſſings: he is alſo your Father, one in whom you have a property, what need you then doubt? what childe is there that caſts not his care upon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? It's the fathers reproach if he either will not or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not provide for his children: will it not redound to Gods reproach when we ſhall be carking for our ſelves, as if we had no God to care for us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1. <hi>The Lord is my ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd I ſhall not want.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we could conceive God were our Father and we his children, the world would be baſe to us, with all its glory, wealth, and pleaſures, we would not be ſollicitous for live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, we would not be ſo confident earthly things being

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:171178:262"/>alluding to that, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.11. <hi>Becauſe Solomon asked an underſtanding heart, and not long life, riches, or the lives of enemies, God gave him that which he did not ask over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove riches and honour.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 The righteouſneſs of ſanctification, as integrity of love, hunger and thirſt after doing Gods will, innocency, charity, and all other graces. Now that ſanctification is called righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, appears, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.25. <hi>It ſhall be our righteouſneſs if we obſerve to do all theſe commandments, Job</hi> 27.6. <hi>My righteouſneſs I hold faſt and will not let it go.</hi> That is, my ſanctification and uprightneſs: but in this ſence righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is onely an intentional conformity to the law of God, and no ſatisfaction to divine juſtice. Many ſeek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, but few ſeek the righteouſneſs thereof: but it's ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea, he was a good man and a juſt, and he waited for the Kingdom of God, Luke</hi> 23.50, 51. and <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Luke</hi> 1.6.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> God hath promiſed outward things to us, but its onely when they are good for us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.11. They that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God ſees outward things in any meaſure not ſo good for us: as a Phyſician that hath ſeen our water, or felt our pulſe, takes away ſuch and ſuch meat from us, becauſe he ſees it not good for us, ſo doth God; or as a father takes away a knife from his child, becauſe he ſees he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to cut his fingers therewith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Gods people ſometimes abuſe his bleſſings to pride, prodigality and exceſs: ſuch children of God may juſtly fear to be pinched. God doth not by promiſe bind himſelf to give us outward things when we ſhall ſpend them upon our luſts, for ſo God ſhould bind himſelf to unjuſt things; but though we begg ſuch things of him, he denyes them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 All promiſe of outward things is with the exception of the Croſs; ſo the cauſe of God ſtanding need of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and for the exerciſe of the faith and patience of his people, ſometimes precious Saints of eminent holineſs have been ſcanted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. <hi>Such of whom the world was not worthy, wandred about in ſheep skins, and Goat skins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute, afflicted, tormented,</hi> but their wants have been made up abundantly with inward comfort. See <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.30.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Unbelief (as to Gods promiſe for outward things) ſometimes ſtraitens Gods hand. We are bid to pray in faith for daily bread, now how can we do this unleſs Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be certain and abſolute. According to the faith of men it will be unto them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy brows thou ſhalt eat thy bread.</hi> As it was a threatning and a
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:171178:263"/>command, ſo was it a promiſe, that we ſweating and taking pains ſhall eat our bread. The perſons that are beggars and extream poor are wicked perſons, who joyn not themſelves to any Church but are diſſolute in life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Though for abuſe of mercies, God ſometimes pinches his children, yet uſually he keeps them from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing, for the abſoluteneſs of his promiſe in temporal things, which are no leſs abſolute then ſpiritual things (as I judge, leaving others to their light herein) as we ſee in ſundry temporal promiſes which are ſet down without any reſtriction. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord and do good, dwell in the land, and in truth and ſtableneſs thou ſhalt be fed,</hi> as the Margin out of the Hebrew reads it. See alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>How ſhall he not with him give us all things alſo?</hi> Firſt mary Chriſt, then have all things with him. See many abſolute promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. No good thing will he with-hold from them that walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.10. The upright ſhall have good things in poſſeſſion, and ſee the three large promiſes in the New Teſtament, this in the Text, and that, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. and that <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.</p>

                  </p>

                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Reprehenſion of thoſe who ſay they truſt God with their ſouls, but dare not truſt him with their bodies,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:171178:263"/>but they will uſe indirect means, but why are they ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident? Surely becauſe their faith is not ſo aſſaulted as to ſpirituals, as it is to temporals; were their faith to be tryed as to the Trinity, Reſurrection, belief of the Creation of the World, a Virgins bringing forth a Son, the day of judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they would no leſs ſhew their unbelief of Gods Word herein, then they do of his Word as to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Exhort; To have outward things, ſet your hearts to ſeek heavenly things, the other then will be added, when you know rightly to value ſpiritual bleſſings: depend on God for temporal things. So long as the ark was in <hi>Obed-Edoms</hi> houſe God proſpered it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a good man and God made all that he did to proſper in his hand, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.3.</p>
                  <p>The contrary practice is that of the world who firſt ſeek earthly things, and think that upon their faint wiſhes when they are upon the bed of ſickneſs, death or other diſtreſſes, heavenly things will be added unto them, contrary to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> counſel, to <hi>remember our Creator in the dayes of youth,</hi> think that old age will be a fitter time, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Eſau</hi> like, preferre a meſſe of pottage before a birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 34. <hi>Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow ſhall take thought for the things of it ſelf: ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is another Argument to take us off from carking for the morrow, that is, for all future time: becauſe to morrow or future time will have cares therein. It is not a part of wiſdom to trouble our ſelves with caring for thoſe things which muſt be cared over again to morrow. Chriſt alludes to the gathering of Manna, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.20. Some out of carking would keep of the Manna until the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it bred worms and ſtank.</p>
                  <p>Future time or to morrow will have its trouble, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:171178:264"/>we need not gather the cares of two dayes into one, which being divided we ſhall more eaſily bear: we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of many troubles and cares which our ſelves create, yet in forbidding care for the morrow he allows cares for the preſent. Not as if all care for the future were unlawful, for the diſciples of <hi>Antioch</hi> cared to ſend relief to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> hearing of a famine, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.29. And, if we ſhould not care for to morrow, we ſhould neither plow nor ſow, build nor plant; therefore Chriſt forbids here, 1 care that flows from unbelief and diſtruſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That care that hinders us from ſeeking heavenly things, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That care of earthly things which goes before our care for heavenly things and Gods Kingdom, which we ought to ſeek in the firſt place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 An a fflicting care concerning future events, which are uncertain, and can neither be foreſeen nor hindred, and its well for us we cannot foreſee them; for could we foreſee all future cares our ſouls would be ſwallowed up of them. Beſides we know not whether we ſhall live till to morrow, and why then ſhould we ſo care for it? <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1. Boaſt not of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth. We know not what may be in the womb of the morning, or what it will bring forth, <hi>Jam</hi> 4.15, 16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 A troubling and diſquieting care. Chriſt did not blame <hi>Martha</hi> for that ſhe was careful to provide, but that her care was ſo overmuch that it troubled her that ſhe could not attend upon Chriſts preaching, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.41, 42. <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> thou neglects a needful thing for a needleſs thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Let every day have its due proportion of care and prayer. Lay not to morrows cares on the preſent day. As <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.20. that he ſhould not ſet
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:171178:264"/>his mind upon his aſſes that were loſt, when a kingdom was befallen him; ſo let us not ſet our cares on tranſitory things when we have great things to think upon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Prepare for new troubles and cares every day of thy life. Earthly buſineſſes come upon us like waves of the Sea; this day hath cares, and to morrow brings cares, and hardly will a day of thy life be free, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.9. All the dayes of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Pilgrimage are ſaid to be evil.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Learn that, inſtead of immoderate thought taking, to commend thy matters to God in prayer: look unto him for bleſſing, ſucceſs, and direction: as the Marriner hath his eye upon the pole ſtar, as well as his hand upon the helme, ſo ſhould we acknowledge God in all our wayes, and he will direct our ſteps, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123.1, 2, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>CHriſt in this Chapter proceeds in giving precepts conducing to faith and godlineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 1 <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged</hi>] This is the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; not as if Chriſt did go about to take away judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Courts of Juſtice, either in Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, which is eſtabliſhed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. but he onely ſpeaks againſt raſh judgments.</p>
               <p>Raſh judgement is a determinate opinion concerning the evil of another upon inſufficient grounds; though the thing be true that we judge, yet if the grounds upon which we
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:171178:265"/>judge be inſufficient, our judgement is raſh judgement. Such was that of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13, 14. who judged <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to be drunk, becauſe her lips moved when ſhe was pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her heart.

And thoſe that may be too light to a firm aſſent, may be ſufficient to ſtir up a ſuſpicion, whereby the minde ſtands in doubt, and inclines to neither part.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Grounds to take us off from raſh judgement.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 It's contrary to that principle, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.12. <hi>To do as we would be done by.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3 Raſh judgement takes away Gods office, in that we will take upon us to judge thoſe things which belong one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Raſh judging it feeds onely our own and other mens fleſh, in that we raiſe up to our ſelves an over-weaning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of our own goodneſs, or flatter others in a ſuppoſed goodneſs by ſpeaking of other mens evils, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. Things that are doubtfull we ought to interpret for the better part.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Thou canſt not judge aright of other mens actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of many circumſtances concerning them; for thou knoweſt not with what minde, or to what end the action was done, nor upon what temptation.</p>

                  <p>Many think to purchaſe to themſelves an opinion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency by darkning the reputation of others by raſh judgement, and ſuppoſe that the detraction from another mans reputation is an addition to their own, but Chriſt here tells them the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Caution againſt raſh judgement. Beware we neither leſſen things well done or well ſpoken, nor interpret doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things in the worſe part, nor aggravate light infirmities,

                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But is all judging here condemned?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: to judge a tree by the fruits is lawfull. It's not the minde of Chriſt that his Diſciples ſhould be blinde towards the evils of others, and not to cenſure and puniſh them, but that we bridle the corruption of our hearts which is much inclining to raſh judgement. Our hearts are like crooked rules that are ready to pervert ſtraight things.</p>
                  <p>Neither is credulity here commended; ſuch as was in <hi>Jacob,</hi> who erred in too much charity, thinking the wild beaſts had devoured <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when his ſons onely ſhewed him a blooded Coat which <hi>Joſeph</hi> wore.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond reaſon why we muſt not raſhly judge others, becauſe God by his providence will afford us the like.</p>

                  <p>Here's a third reaſon againſt raſh judging, taken from the adjunct. Such perſons have beams or groſs ſins in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are prone to cenſure motes or infirmities in others. Self love blindes many that they cannot ſee groſs ſins in themſelves, but can ſee ſuppoſed ſins in others.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>Or how wilt thou ſay to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye, and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fourth reaſon taken from unprofitableneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:171178:267"/>ſuch judgings do not tend to the amending but to the hardening of the ſinner. He that will judg others had need examine himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether may not a Judg condemn thoſe ſins in another which he knows himſelf to have committed, or at preſent knows he liveth in?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, becauſe every Judg is bound to judg ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, where evils are proſecuted and witneſſed in any outward Court of men, but not where they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and witneſſed in the inner Court of conſcience, for that Court onely belongs to God: and though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1. ſay, that ſuch men are inexcuſable who judg others for thoſe things themſelves do, it's meant onely in the Court of conſcience, or the Court of Heaven, not in the Courts of men, which looks upon all men as innocent, againſt whom there is no witneſs of guilt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, how wilt thou ſay to thy Brother? that is, with what face? upon what ground of conſcience or honeſty wilt thou ſay? Let me pull out thy Mote, when thou haſt the Beam of a reigning ſin in thee, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.14, 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> All ſins are not equal; ſome are reigning ſins, ſome are ſins of infirmity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Many perſons, though guilty of great ſins, yet are not ſenſible of them; ſome have beams yet ſee it not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Men that would reform ſmall ſins in others muſt firſt reform great ſins in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V,</hi> 5. <hi>Thou Hypocrite, firſt caſt out the Beam out of thine own Eye, and then thou ſhalt clearly ſee to caſt out the Mote out of thy Brothers Eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are an Anſwer to an Objection. It ſeems then I need not care how my Brother lives, whether well or ill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, thou muſt.</p>
                  <p>Hence Chriſt adds <hi>v.</hi> 5. that we ſhould perform to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them the duty of admonition. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. But Hypocrites, upon pretence of admonition, ſometimes
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:171178:267"/>exerciſe a maſterly power of judging, contrary to the Rule of Charity, which requires with all tenderneſs that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into, and deal with the weakneſſes of our Brethren with a deſire of healing of them; but this cannot he do who hath greater faults of his own. Thy Brother whom thou reproves cannot learn a better amendment by thee than that he ſees in thee. Reproof is ſo to be ordered, that not onely the faults of our Brother be blamed, but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof may attain the true end thereof, to wit, the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſinner, which will be brought about the better when thy life reproves him as well as thy words.</p>
                  <p>As it's impoſſible for him that hath a beam in his eye, to pull out a mote out of another mans, becauſe the beam blindes him that he cannot ſee the mote; ſo a man blinded with any reigning ſin, he cannot ſee infirmities in others to amend them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> mentions that among the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> their Profeſſours were wont to deliver their Precepts in Proverbs, and ſo doth Chriſt, as before, ſo here and elſewhere: it is a demonſtrative kinde of teaching practiſed by <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 12.10.</p>
                  <p>In the words two things, 1 A Precept, <hi>Give not that which is holy to Dogs.</hi> 2 The Reaſons, 1 <hi>Leſt they tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple them under their feet.</hi> 2 <hi>Leſt they turn again and rend you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:171178:268"/>
                  <p n="1">1 The Precept. <hi>Give not that which is holy to Dogs.</hi> Some by Dogs underſtand Unbelievers, as if the Word, Baptiſm and Supper ſhould not be given to them. For Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm and the Supper it appears they ought not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as being not converting Ordinances, but ſigns and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratives of converſion already wrought. Were they converting Ordinances they ſhould actively, effectively and operatively produce the grace of Regeneration, and after a phyſical manner work upon the ſoul, whereas they work onely in, by, and through the underſtanding, and therefore muſt be adminiſtred on thoſe believers that have underſtanding to receive them; but for the Word, it being Gods means to bring perſons <hi>from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to Gods Kingdom, Acts</hi> 18.26. it ought to be offered to all.</p>
                  <p>Therefore by Dogs is meant the ſtubborn and profeſſed Enemies of the Goſpel, who having formerly been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of it are now apoſtatized, and ceaſe not to rail and perſecute that truth. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.9. when divers ſpake evil of the way of God before the multitude, <hi>Paul</hi> departed from them.</p>
                  <p>Others more pertinently reſtrain that which is holy, to admonition, whereof he had ſpoke; this ought not to be given to Dogs and Swine, of which <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Reprove not a Scorner leſt he hate thee, reprove a wiſe man and he will love thee. Prov.</hi> 23.9. <hi>Speak not in the ears of a fool for he will deſpiſe the wiſdom of thy words;</hi> onely we muſt not forbear the duty of admonition to them, that it may do ſome good to, upon this pretence, as if they were Dogs or Hogs, when we perceive no ſuch thing by them, for our hearts are but too backward to perform this duty, becauſe we ſee it ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to moſt men.</p>
                  <p>By dogs Chriſt means contradictors and blaſphemers againſt admonition, whether publickly in the miniſtry of the Word, as the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. who
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:171178:269"/>hereby adjudged themſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, and the Apoſtles upon their contradiction turned to the Gentiles,<note place="margin">See Matth. 10.14, 15.</note> ſo did <hi>Paul</hi> in the like caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.9. depart into the ſchool of <hi>Tyrannus</hi> upon the contradiction the Jews made againſt his doctrine. Such were thoſe circumciſion teachers whom <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>dogs,</hi> Phil. 3.2. <hi>Beware of dogs,</hi> and perhaps thoſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. <hi>without are dogs,</hi> are here meant, and alſo Chriſt means private admonition, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.9. When perſons ſhall rage againſt it, the Lord provides for the ſafety of his ſervants, leaſt for their good will they be rent in pieces by the ungodly.</p>
                  <p>By holy things and pearls then Chriſt means publick and private admonition: they are called holy becauſe the perſons that give it are holy, and becauſe the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even the admonition is holy, and becauſe of the end, which is the ſanctification of ſouls.</p>
                  <p>They are called Pearls for their preciouſneſs and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5. Admonition is compared to an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Oyl.</p>
                  <p>By hogs Chriſt means they do not contradict, but by the uncleanneſs of their lives they ſhow their contempt of your admonitions.</p>
                  <p>Its one thing to tread holy admonitions under our feet, as hogs do and thoſe that wallow in their ſins, and another thing to bite and rend him that reaches holy admonitions to us as dogs do: ſuch an one was <hi>Creſcens</hi> the Cynick Philoſopher, from whom <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> expected his death. As Chriſt would not have publick and private admonition to be given for their ſake, ſo would he not have it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kept ſilent for their ſake. Of this ſort of dogs are many, who ſtir up, not onely Magiſtrates but the common people againſt the profeſſors of truth, becauſe the truth ſuch hold forth is contrary to their profit and praiſe, as we ſee in Chriſt and the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons of this are, 1 The unprofitableneſs and
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:171178:269"/>unworthineſs. Your labour will be ſpent in vain, they will trample theſe precious things under their feet. Things that are ſlighted and counted nothing worth are trod in the mire, as pearles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to them that know not their worth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Your own ſafety; they will turn again and rend you, they will prepare fire, ſword, priſons and baniſhment againſt you; and therefore as no man will meddle with a mad Dog for fear he be bit by him, ſo ſhould we beware of ſuch Dogs.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome wicked men though they be not cured yet are they curable; to theſe admonitions may be given; but ſome are incurable, to whom they are not to be given.</p>
                  <p>And though we are to give a reaſon of the hope in us to every man, yet is it onely to them that ask a reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which Hogs and Dogs do not.</p>
                  <p>So that as in the former Verſe Chriſt ſhowes who and what kinde the reprovers ſhould be, ſuch as were free from beams or groſs evils, ſo here in this Verſe he ſhowes who the perſons to be reproved muſt be, not Dogs nor Hogs, but ſuch as will receive an admonition.</p>
                  <p>

There are two things that hinder prayer, to wit ſloth, and unbelief; againſt ſloth Chriſt bids us <hi>ask, ſeek, knock,</hi> and againſt unbelief Chriſt ſaith, <hi>whoſoever asketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened.</hi> Nothing more ſtirs up a ſoul to prayer then a confidence of being heard, and nothing makes a man more heartleſs then the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Now for the things believers ſhould ask they are the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. heavenly wiſedome, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. both which <hi>Paul</hi> conjoyns and bids us <hi>pray for the ſpirit of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18. alſo, <hi>increaſes of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe three, <hi>ask, ſeek,</hi> and <hi>knock,</hi> ſignifie moſt fervent begging of God, or a begging with perſeverance; they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie we ſhould pray believingly, diligently, fervently, and perſeverantly. If men uſe to give being ſo importuned, how much more will God? As Chriſt ſhowes in the following verſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For every one that asketh receiveth] Pſal.</hi> 81.7. <hi>Thou cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledſt in trouble and I delivered thee, Pſal.</hi> 50.15. The words ſeem to be taken out of <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.12, 13. <hi>Then ſhall ye call upon me and I will hearken unto you, and ye ſhall ſeek me and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4.</p>
                  <p>This promiſe is to be underſtood, that we ask according to the qualifications before laid down, as that we ask in faith, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> It's incouragement to us to come to God in all our wants. <hi>While they ſpeak I will hear, Eſa.</hi> 65.24. Every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:171178:271"/>may ſay of himſelf and others as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of the Jews, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What Nation is there that hath God ſo nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call unto him for?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Onely you muſt ask things that God hath promiſed, or at leaſt commanded us to ask for, not hurtfull things, as to ask riches to ſpend them upon our luſts; not curious things. The mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> ſons deſiring that her ſons might ſit one at Chriſts right hand the other at Chriſts left hand in his Kingdome, was repulſed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 9, <hi>For what man is there among you, which if his ſon ask him bread, would give him a ſtone?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 10, <hi>Or if he ask a fiſh will he give him a Serpent?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>If ye then that are evil know how to give good things to your children, how much more ſhall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are an argument from the leſs to the greater. Fathers, though bad men, will give good things to their children, much more will God being a good father, give good things to his children when they ask them of him. Mark, Chriſt argues onely for giving good things to Gods children, not to others: to his children God will give, and more liberally, then men will to theirs.</p>
                  <p>When a ſon asks bread if the father ſhould give him a ſtone it would be unprofitable for him, and if he ſhould ask fiſh and the father ſhould give him a ſerpent that is like a fiſh he would give him that which is hurtfull, and would poyſon him; ſurely then God will not give his children thoſe things which are either unprofitable for them, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto them: God in mercy ſometimes hears us not, but denies us that which we ask, that he may give us that which may do us more good.</p>

                     <hi>If ye being evil know how to give good things]</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and holy men are ſaid to be evil, 1 Comparatively, in reſpect of God, <hi>Job</hi> 15.14, 15, 16. the heavens are not pure in his ſight, as the Moon is dark in compariſon of the Sun, or 2 Becauſe of the unregenerate part remaining in godly men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>I know that in my fleſh dwels no good thing.</hi> He doth not mean his fleſh properly ſo taken, in which the Spirit of God dwelt, who was good, yea good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, but his unregenerate part.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 The bowels of God towards his children are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more then the bowels of an earthly father towards his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 12. <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this command Chriſt warns us that we ſhould do as we would be done by. The Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> had this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which he had received from Chriſtians or Jews, <hi>quod tibi non vis alteri nè feceris,</hi> what thou willeſt not to thy ſelf thou ſhalt not do to another.</p>
                  <p>Self-love doth ſo blinde us that to judge rightly we muſt change the perſon.</p>
                  <p>This is the foundation of all equity, that we would not do to any what we would not ſuffer. If you look upon him him as unrighteous that offers you wrong, look upon your ſelf as unrighteous that offer wrong to another. You would not that another man ſhould over-reach you, or take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a miſtake of you, nor with-hold any due right from you or your children, you would that every man ſhould love you, do you ſo to others. This is a ſhort ſum of all righteouſneſs. You would not any man ſhould hurt
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:171178:272"/>you, do not ye hurt others; let this rule be in our buying, ſelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore]</hi> This Illative Conjunction hath reſpect to the foregoing precepts of this Sermon, as for giving alms, and loving our neighbour, and not judging raſhly, and doth conclude from them, and ſo <hi>Luke</hi> carries it, and doth not conclude from what went immediately before, as ſome carry it, you would that you ſhould be heard ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt things of God, therefore you muſt hear your neighbour asking juſt things of you; which though it be a truth, yet is it not the propper inference, becauſe Chriſt ſpeaks not of our acting towards God but towards men. Though ſome think this word therefore to be redundant.</p>
                  <p>This precept is to be underſtood onely in juſt things: for elſe a drunkard may reaſon, becauſe I make him drunk, let him make me drunk, or an adulterer may ſay, I lay with my neighbours wife, and let him lye with mine, or to give rayling for rayling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For this is the Law and the Prophets]</hi> The words are the reaſon of Chriſts command, becauſe all the Scriptures aym at this, not onely the Old Teſtament but the New, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.14. Love fulfills the Law in reſpect of parts not in reſpect of degrees, but juſtification by the Law is not unleſs it be fulfilled both wayes; Charity being imperfect, the operations of it muſt needs be imperfect. In thoſe places <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes the Law is fulfilled, in this thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf, this is the ſumme and ſcope the Law and Goſpel propounds as to men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to love our neighbour as our ſelf is to do to him as we would have him do to us, were we in his caſe, for it ſeems to me that thoſe two Scriptures and this of Chriſt aim at one thing. You would not have your wealth, wife, name taken from you, do not you take it from others. Now Chriſt ſaith not, this is the whole Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, for <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.38, 39. The law ſtabliſhes the loving
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:171178:272"/>of God with all our heart, as the chief commandement, and love, and juſtice to our neighbour as the next. We are apt to require righteouſneſs from our neighbours to us but backward to return it. Subjects, Princes, Parents, Children, Maſters, Servants ſhould do in their relations as they would be done by, if they were in the correlation.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 They move queſtions not any way tending to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but either curious, or captious queſtions, they <hi>dote about queſtions and ſtrife of words, being full of perverſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 6 4, 5. full of revilings againſt the faithfull ſervants of Chriſt, and thoſe which are the moſt eminent inſtruments of his Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Alſo they go to preach without any call, either of a true gift, or of a true Church, or Paſtour, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2, 3, 4. Alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. True Prophets have uſually had a call by thoſe who have had a greater meaſure of the ſpirit to judge then the perſon called. Onely men that are likely to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full this way, may be tried. The Lord complains that the Prophets propheſied without his ſending, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14, 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21, 22. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets yet they ran, I have not ſpoken to them yet they propheſied.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7 Alſo a bold pretending to know and ſearch hearts, which is onely proper to God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.39. <hi>Thou, even thou onely knoweſt the hearts of the children of men;</hi> they will tell a man they never ſaw before, that he is an hypocrite and wicked.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Alſo ſadding the hearts of the righteous, and gladding the hearts of the wicked, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Alſo to build up and comfort ſouls with a falſe peace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13, 10, 11. one cried peace when there was no peace. One falſe Prophet by his flattery built a wall of carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and another daub'd it with untempered morter. This is called a ſowing of Pillows, <hi>v.</hi> 18. telling perſons on their death-beds you have kept your Church, and been good to the poor, and peaceable among your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Vain-glory alſo is a fruit of a falſe Prophet, <hi>John</hi> 7.18. <hi>He that ſpeaks of himſelf ſeeks his own glory.</hi> Contrarily faithfull Teachers preach not themſelves but <hi>Chriſt Jeſus the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>John</hi> 3.30.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Alſo diſſimulation is a fruit of a falſe Prophet; he endeavours to make perſons to believe otherwiſe of things then he himſelf doth, as of the Scriptures, that they are of God, but yet onely for ſuch a time, not for a conſtant rule of faith: he believs the reſurrection, but he means a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reſurrection, not a bodily, of the ſame body commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the earth.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Alſo bitter invectives againſt inſtrumental teaching, that they may draw Diſciples after themſelves, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30, 31.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 Alſo they carry you from the light of the Scriptures to the light within you, contrary to <hi>Eſai</hi> 8.20. to the law and to the teſtimony. If they ſpeak not according to that, it is becauſe there is no light in them. Thou haſt no light within, who carrieſt perſons from the Scriptures; how can the light within thee check thee for any thing but from the
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:171178:277"/>light of Gods word? The Word uſed thirty times in the New Teſtament for Conſcience, is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, a <hi>knowledge together with:</hi> this conſcience together with God witneſſes all our purpoſes, words and actions, whether good or evill, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. But whence doth it witneſs for or againſt us? even from the light of the Word. A man might commit idolatry and perſecution every day, and yet not be troubled at it if he do not know the Law of God. Unleſs the knowledge of Gods word be in our mindes, the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot exerciſe its judicial act in determining of the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of our actions. Hence, when the Scripture would ſtir up a mans conſcience, it appeals to his knowledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15, 16, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.23, 24.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 Alſo the denying of Ordinances, upon pretence of immediate communion with God. Theſe falſe Prophets caſt off the Ordinances wherein God and the ſoul of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have communion, they throw down Chriſts ordinances and inſtitutions, that Satans inſpirations and revelations may be inſtead of them. Becauſe there are ſome Allegories in the Scriptures they turn all into Allegories, that they may carry us into a Wood whence we may not finde our way out, and all to ſtabliſh theſe fooleries; and yet theſe men judge themſelves to have come into a ſtate of perfection, judging others to be children who uſe ordinances. But, that they may not ſeem to be mad without reaſon, they bring ſome arguments, as 1 The diſtinction put betwixt the Law and Goſpel, called Letter and Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. by Letter is meant the Law, by the Spirit the Goſpel. The Goſpel is called Spirit comparatively, becauſe there is a greater powring out of the Spirit now then formerly. Some by Letter underſtand the Law, and by Spirit the gifts of the Spirit, as tongues, propheſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I lean to the former, becauſe ſo expounded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. where, by <hi>old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Letter,</hi> the Apoſtle underſtands a principle of natural conſcience, and, by <hi>newneſs of the Spirit,</hi> a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:171178:278"/>of regeneration. For theſe Ordinances of Baptiſm and Supper, God appointed them as helps to our faith, through which is livelily held forth a crucified Chriſt for remiſſion of ſins to a believing ſoul: for not divers things but one and the ſame is ſignified in both thoſe ordinances of Baptiſm and the Supper, to wit, remiſſion of ſins to believers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentants.</p>
                  <p>For the duration and perpetuity of ordinances till the end of the world, take theſe reaſons:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe there hath been ſince the Apoſtles times throughout all ages a Church, therefore Ordinances, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Unto him be glory in the Church throughout all ages:</hi> therefore in every age there will be both Church and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe there is a command of our performance and obſervation of them to the end of the world, and a promiſe of Gods preſence with us in ſo doing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. Make Diſciples in all Nations — <hi>Lo I am preſent with you to the end of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>So oft as ye eat this bread and drink this Cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> What warrant have any believers to make a change till the Lord come? No more warrant to put an end to Baptiſm then to making Diſciples, or the teaching the obſervation of Chriſts Commandements.</p>
                  <p>I can well nigh trace this deluſion to the beginning. In the year 1644 divers Books were printed againſt Infant-baptiſm, the arguments whereof prevailed againſt Infant-baptiſm that many Commanders in the Army were againſt it, but the Parliament and times being much for it, theſe Commanders were troubled to keep in with conſcience and with the times, ſundry perſons diſputing that theſe Officers were bound to take up the Baptiſm of Believers. In this juncture of time comes a Chaplain to the Army, who being forced out of the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> was in the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with theſe Gentlemen; he comes and preaches a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:171178:278"/>that Baptiſme and the ſupper were onely carnal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and types, and that they ended in the firſt age, or to that effect; ſo this doctrine being received with great applauſe, this preacher, formerly of little acquaintance, came in one month to be one of the moſt eminent preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the army, and theſe Gentlemen formerly troubled might now by the arguments of Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi> eaſily bundle the times and their principles againſt infant Baptiſme toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whiles hereby they were kept from the principles of the Anabaptiſts. Though the ſaid Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly conferred with me to Baptize him, which I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do, onely through worldly prudence he deſired a place to be digged firſt in his own houſe, to eſcape the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of the times, but at the end of four dayes when he had appointed me to come to diſpenſe it, he came to queſtion the power of the diſpenſer, ſo I departed home and left him. About ſix months after I being with him reaſoned ſo far, that in one after-noon I anſwered his arguments and wifes, being many, till they had no more to ſay, ſave this, they were convinced, but they muſt ſtay till God did perſwade, after which time he ſpeedily went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Army, the product and ſpawn of whoſe preachings and printings were theſe deluſions about denying ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which groundedly may be ſuſpected was both to ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and hearers the puniſhment for dallying with truth, and denying ſubmiſſion to it after conviction. My conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells me that the thing I write of him was truth, and he was my intimate friend, whom I ſhould in no wiſe have cited ſo publick, but that conſcience to God for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving of others urgeth me.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 The laſt ſort of fruits by falſe Prophets is that the Scriptures have their period and time of expiration, and that every leſs light is ſwallowed up by a greater; the light of <hi>Moſes</hi> by the light of the Prophets, the light of the Prophets by the light of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and the light
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:171178:279"/>of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> by the light of the Spirit. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures they acknowledg were Gods Word, and the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men inſpired by God, but it was to endure for a time; hence they allege 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.19. <hi>We do well to take heed to the Scriptures, as to a light ſhining in a dark place, till the day dawn and the day-ſtar ariſe in their hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens at theſe, be ye horribly afraid. The horridneſs of this Deluſion wants tears of bloud ſufficiently to bewail it, that apoſtate Profeſſours the authours of theſe Deluſions, ſhould labour as it were to kill God and his Word with his own Weapons. I might wave all Scripture-reaſon with theſe that deny the Scripture, and reaſon with them onely as Philoſophers, alſo I might let the Reader ſee that this damnable errour is an epitome of all errour. But to anſwer that place 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.19. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhews that if theſe diſperſed <hi>Jews</hi> attended to the Scriptures of the Prophets they would have a light to guide them in their darkneſs, till the day at laſt appear, and the morning-ſtar, the ſign thereof, ſcatter their darkneſs; that is, till the light of the Goſpel clearly manifeſt unto you this myſtery of godlineſs which ye have begun to receive.</p>
                  <p>Some interpret thus, that Propheſie is the Night or Darkneſs, the Goſpel is the Light or Morning Star, the ſight of God in Heaven is clear Day: ſo the ſenſe is, Attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reading and ſtudy of the Prophets, that ye may be ſtrengthened by them in the faith of Chriſt, untill the Day Star, that is, a more clear knowledg of the faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſhine unto you, that ye being confirmed therein may thereby be brought to the bleſſedneſs of Heaven. The ſight of faith in compariſon of the ſight in Heaven is but as the Dawning of the Morning to the Light of the Sun at Noon. And as the Morning Star is a Middle betwixt Night and Day, ſo is the Doctrine of the Goſpel a Middle betwixt the dark Doctrine of the Prophets, and the clear ſight in Heaven. So that by Day Star is not meant Chriſt whom
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:171178:279"/>theſe believing <hi>Jews</hi> had already received, but their going on and increaſe in the faith, whiles by little and little their knowledg became more certain concerning the Myſteries of Chriſt, that no doubts or ſcruples concerning the Chriſtian Faith or any point of it might be any longer in their mindes.</p>
                  <p>Some by <hi>Day dawning</hi> and <hi>Day Star</hi> underſtand the ſight of God in Heaven; our Life of Miſery in this World being like Night, the Life to come will be like Day, when all ſhadows of mortality, errour and ignorance ſhall vaniſh away. See <hi>Song</hi> 2.17.</p>
                  <p>This word <hi>[Untill]</hi> favours this Interpretation, becauſe we need Propheſie and the Scriptures all our Life long till we come in Heaven. But both Intepretations are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, and then the ſenſe will be, Take heed to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the Prophets, and Goſpel, as to the means for your going on in the Faith, and building up, untill you come to the beatifical viſion of the glory in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But never did the Apoſtle or Spirit mean that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word ſhould have its period and time ſet to laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which it is uſeleſs and improper to attend unto it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond place is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20, 21, 27. <hi>But ye have an Unction from the Holy One, and ye ſhall know all things—but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this Scripture, they argue thus, they that have the Teachings of the Spirit have no need of the teaching of the Letter, but they have the Unction of the Spirit that teacheth them all things, therefore they need neither the teaching of the Letter, nor the teachings of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Three things to be opened, 1 What is meant by Unction?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By Unction is meant Chriſtianity, for as a Chriſtian in <hi>Greek</hi> is the ſame that Anointed is, ſo Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is the ſame that Anointing is; now Chriſtianity is
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:171178:280"/>the Doctrine, grace and wiſdom of Chriſt, which from the inſpiration of the Spirit is given, whereby we are inſtructed in all the believables and duties of a true Chriſtian which pertain to Chriſtian faith and life, and to fly heretical and Antichriſtian tenents. Now this heavenly Light is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Oyl, becauſe the principal uſe of Oyl is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Light; it hath other virtues, as to cool, to chear, to heal, but this is the principal; ſo that by Unction he means the Oyl of holy Doctrine or Truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is meant by this anointing teaching us <hi>all things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By <hi>all things</hi> are not meant every individual truth, for the Apoſtles themſelves knew onely in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. therefore we muſt underſtand it reſtrictively to the matter in hand. <hi>Ye know all things,</hi> that is, concerning the ſhunning of Antichriſt and holding the Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Or by <hi>all things</hi> he means all things he had formerly taught them, ſo that he rather remembers them and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them of things that he writ, than delivers any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which were new unto them: therefore <hi>v.</hi> 24. he bids that that might remain with them which they had heard from the beginning.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is meant by this Phraſe, <hi>Ye need not that any man teach you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not cry down miniſterial teaching, for then ſhould he have cried down his own teaching, and nullified many other Precepts wherein Preachers are commanded to preach the Word, <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and the Miniſtry is given for <hi>the perfecting of the Saints, Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. but onely warns them againſt falſe Teachers, who taught them contrary Doctrines to thoſe, wherein by the Doctrine of Truth they had been informed; theſe errours the Apoſtle calls Lyes, <hi>v.</hi> 22. as being moſt abominable Lyes to deny <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="549" facs="tcp:171178:280"/>
                  <p>So that the ſenſe is, Ye have the Light of the Word wherein you have been inſtructed to teach you all things needfull for your ſalvation, ſo that you are not to liſten to any Impoſtours that teach you the contrary; but from hence to deduce, that becauſe you have the Teachings of the Spirit, that we need not the Teachings of men, is a grand Deluſion.</p>
                  <p>A third Argument is, <hi>The Elect ſhall be all taught of God, John</hi> 6.45. So that they ſhall not teach <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for all ſhall know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt, Heb.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There is a twofold Teaching, 1 Notional, 2 Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate. Of the later of theſe the Scripture ſpeaks. The Lord teaches the Elect or Children of the new Covenant, as no man can teach with the like, he gives them a relliſh of good things, but becauſe the Lord teaches after this way that no man can teach, it follows not that therefore the Apoſtle excludes the teaching of man, for then why would Chriſt ſend out his Apoſtles and the ſeventy Diſciples, and why doth he eſtabliſh a Miniſtry in his Church, one eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial property whereof is that he muſt be apt to teach, yea doth not Chriſt bid us pray to the Lord of the Harveſt for ſuch Labourers. Chriſt alſo ſhews us that from the Lords teaching as a principal cauſe, the Miniſtry of man becomes effectual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                  <p>There are many other fruits of falſe Prophets, as the ſoothing and flattering of Princes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.6. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The mingling of Truth and Errour together, or at leaſt truth and corrupt affections, from which the Apoſtle clears himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                  <p>There are many other notes of falſe Prophets, which by a frequent reading of the Scriptures, and begging of the Spirit, we may attain to know.</p>
                  <pb n="550" facs="tcp:171178:281"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their Fruits. Do men gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look as of Thorn-trees men do not gather Grapes, nor of Thiſtles men do not gather Figgs, ſo from falſe Prophets there is no good and ſweet fruit gathered, but the harſh and corrupt fruit of Errour and Hereſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>Even ſo every good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit, but a corrupt Tree bringeth forth corrupt Fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt here comes to confirm unto us further that men do not gather good fruits from bad trees, and makes a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the former Propoſition laid down interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
                  <p>By good and bad Trees in general the ſtate of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and unregenerate man may be underſtood, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.33. Carnal men cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>Abel</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was firſt reſpected, then his offering, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4.</p>
                  <p>In particular Chriſt means the Prophets, when good they bring forth good fruit, when corrupt they bring forth corrupt fruit; when good, they handle the Word of God uprightly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17.4.2. when corrupt, they handle Gods Word deceitfully, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14.</p>
                  <p>Such falſe Prophets are not known by the leaves or flowers of an outward profeſſion, but by their fruits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt amplifies what he had delivered, ſhewing that a good will from the habit of grace in the ſoul brings forth good things ordinarily and uſually, and an evil will from the habit of ſin in the ſoul brings evil things. But Chriſt means firſt, the man muſt be changed that his works may be changed. But who is found good of the Lord, ſeeing Chriſt died for ſinners, therefore he found us all bad Trees, but gave us power to believe on his Name, <hi>Aug. de Verb. Domini Serm.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>But if we carry it to Teachers, we muſt underſtand it ſo
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:171178:281"/>far as he is a good Teacher (for even good Teachers have been miſtaken in ſome things) they cannot bring forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Doctrine, nor can a corrupt Teacher, ſo far as he is corrupt, bring forth good Doctrine. It's uſual that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the body are ſutable to the qualities of the minde, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.34, 35. <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good, an evil man out of the evil treaſure of his heart brings forth that which is evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we underſtand it of men, we muſt underſtand it of men as in their natural eſtate. But as a Tree when it is tranſplanted brings forth good fruit, though naturally without tranſplantation it could not; ſo when perſons are tranſplanted out of their natural eſtate into Chriſt, they bring forth good fruits, <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5. though in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate they could not.</p>
                  <p>If we carry it to Teachers, as Chriſt means both, then the meaning is, if theſe Prophets were true lovers of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they would ſeem to be, they would not uſually commit ſuch things as are directly contrary to godlineſs as they do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>Every Tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen down and caſt into the fire.</hi>

                  <p>Here's the puniſhment of falſe Prophets. The words are a ſimilitude taken from an Husbandman, and are denounced againſt all Hypocrites in general, who have the leaves of profeſſion, but want the power of godlineſs, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular againſt hypocritical falſe Prophets. <hi>John</hi> 15.6. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a Branch that is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,</hi> and men gather them and caſt them into the fire and they are burned: as the Husbandman caſts fruitleſs Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into the fire, ſo will <hi>Chriſt</hi> caſt ſuch as bring not forth good fruit into the fire of Hell. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, falſe Prophets bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, <hi>Their judgment lingers not, and their damnation ſlumbers not,</hi> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2 1, 3.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore by their fruits ye ſhall know them]</hi> Chriſt here concludes thus, <hi>q. d.</hi> ſeeing men uſually teach things ſuitable to their manners and practiſes, by ſuch kinde of corrupt Teachings you may ſuſpect theſe Prophets before they inſtill or drop in their opinions into you, for ſuch as the Maſters are ſuch will they make the Scholars, ſuch as the Tree is ſuch will the Fruits be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt from reprehending falſe Prophets, comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all hypocritical Formaliſts, whether teachers or hearers, who pretend the faith and doctrine of Chriſt in a great ſhew of holineſs, but deny it in their works. They propheſied in the Name of Chriſt, and wrought miracles, but did not do Chriſt his will.</p>
                  <p>In the words two things, 1 An excluſion of hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Formaliſts, or formal Hypocrites, out of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, &amp;c.</hi> A name without a thing is nothing.

Gods ſcope was not to make trial of the wits of men, who could ſharplieſt conceive, nor of their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who could faithfullieſt retain, or of their eloquence, who could roundlieſt diſcourſe, but of their wills, who would moſt obediently do them; this being his chief ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have his throne and command, not in the head and brains, but in the ſtrong hold of their hearts and lives. <hi>David</hi> did not onely delight in Gods commands, but he lifted up his hands to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.47, 48. for to do them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will liken him unto a wiſe man which built his houſe upon the rock]</hi> That is upon a rocky ground, taking away all the looſe mold that covered the rock. A Chriſtian when he builds, digs deep; and caſts out the looſe earth, to denote that believers, knowing there is much falſhood and hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their hearts, therefore when they have heard the Word, they ſuſpect their own hypocriſie and formall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Word, hence they dig up their hearts by ſoul-ſearching humiliation to finde out the prevailing iniquity of their hearts, which keeps them from an even and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant walking with God. How much greater weight of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any man intends to build, ſo much deeper he digs the foundation, and the fabrick when it is built riſes on high: but he that digs the foundation is preſt down below, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:171178:288"/>the fabrick is made low before the height, and the top is rais'd up after the humiliation, <hi>Aug. de verb. Dom. Ser.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>Carnall profeſſors, on the contrary, have all their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above ground, and therefore he thinks he hath done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if he do onely talk a little of good things, he ſpends no time in digging and ſearching, that is in grieving and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting for his corruptions, nor in reforming what's amiſs. Hence <hi>Luke</hi> adds theſe words which <hi>Matthew</hi> omits, <hi>viz. He digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock, Luke</hi> 6.47, 48.</p>
                  <p>By the building the houſe upon the rock, is meant the placing our faith upon Chriſt, as the prop of our ſalvation, for Chriſt is called a rock, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. As an houſe built upon the ſand is an hypocritical formal profeſſion or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary faith, ſo the houſe built upon the rock is ſaving, juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, which, as it pitcheth on Jeſus Chriſt, ſo it ſhews it ſelf by all gracious fruits, and univerſal obſervations of all Chriſts commands. It pitches on Chriſt as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20, 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The words ſeem to be taken out of <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.25. <hi>As the whirlewinde paſſeth, ſo is the wicked no more; but the righteous is an everlaſting foundation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the rain, floods and windes, are meant inward and outward temptations, which true and ſound faith will be able to endure; upon this rock Chriſt builds his Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. much leſs ſhall any of Satans temptations, of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſelf-murther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Satan darts into the ſoul, nor any perſecutions, baniſhments or impriſonments, which the inſtruments of Satan ſtir up againſt true believers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt them. This Advocate on whom the faith of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:171178:289"/>pitcheth, prayed for us when he was on earth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31. <hi>Satan hath deſired to have You, that he may ſift You, but I have prayed for thee,</hi> and conſequently for other belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>that your faith fail not,</hi> and now he intercedes for us in heaven.</p>
                  <p>No other foundation ſave Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. can any man lay, without believing on whom we muſt look to die in our ſins, <hi>John</hi> 8.24. other foundations of wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and earthly greatneſs, will not be able to make us bear up againſt the ſtream of temptations. Intereſt in God, through Jeſus Chriſt, is that which keeps up the ſoul in the midſt of greateſt ſtorms. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.5, 6.27.1, 2, 3.46.1, 2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.23, 24, 25. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7.125.1.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt doth not ſay that believers ſhall be without trials and temptations; nay theſe above all other muſt look for ſtorms and tempeſts, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. but they do not fall by them. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Whoſoever will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. Trial and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhowes what men are. Every man is that in truth out of temptation, which he ſheweth himſelf to be in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. A wiſe builder is wiſe before ſtormes come, but how will that be known? by the ſtanding of his houſe in the time of a ſtorm. Profeſſors generally ſeem to ſtick alike to Chriſt, till a temptation come, but unſound men in time of temptation fall away, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. The carnal Profeſſor is like <hi>Orpah</hi> to her mother <hi>Naomi,</hi> the ſincere Profeſſor like <hi>Ruth.</hi> Unſound Profeſſors are uſually drawn aſide by earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyments on the one hand, as the young man, or by ſtorms of perſecution and ſuffering on the other hand: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26.</p>
                  <p>We may judge of our patience what it is, when we have a wrong offered us; of our temperance what it is, when we are at a great feaſt; of our love to God what it is, when ſome great thing is to be left for a good conſcience; of our
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:171178:289"/>ſincerity what it is, by what we do when no man ſees us; of our liberality what it is, when God preſents an object of mercy to us. It was ſweetly inſtanced by a reverend Preacher; <hi>Peter</hi> was a good houſe, <hi>Judas</hi> was an ill houſe. When a ſtorm came <hi>Peter</hi> loſt a ſlate or two, as the beſt houſe may, yet the foundation and the ſide walls ſtood firm, but <hi>Judas,</hi> when Chriſt rebuked him, he was full of wrath, and when the Prieſts offered him money he was full of covetouſneſs, ſo thinking to gain more by ſelling Chriſt then by ſerving him, he betrayed him to his adverſaries, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> being good under his fathers government, continued good under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Infidels, where he had all means of damnation but none of ſalvation. The ſame he was in his fathers houſe he was in <hi>Potiphars</hi> houſe, and in the priſon, and after in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Court, which was the moſt dangerous temptation of all, being a young man, a ruler, and a rich man, in which three conſiderations there were many ſnares, as appears from that young rich Ruler, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.18. who left Chriſt rather then his enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> It's a great point of wiſedome to joyn doing to our hearing. Chriſt likens ſuch to a wiſe man. A Sermon is but half heard when it is heard from the Preachers mouth. Be ye like <hi>Johns</hi> hearers, deſirous to know your own duty with intention to do it, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6.</p>

                  <p n="8">8 In caſe, words tending to no profit but to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of hearers ſhall be brought, the Preacher is to charge them before the Lord, <hi>That they ſtrive not about words to no profit,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16.

                  <p n="10">10 Herewith rejoycing. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy word was unto me the joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of my heart.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> So they did, and it was well that they did; but,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Hypocrites joy in ſome part onely, but right hearers joy in every part; hypocrites joy in the promiſes not in the precepts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hypocrites joy in the notion onely, but the right hearer joys in thoſe truths, as having an intereſt in them. We rejoyce in the ſight of a Diamond, but joy more in the property.</p>
                  <pb n="577" facs="tcp:171178:294"/>
                  <p>The joy of one is like the joy of a man that is glad to ſee a fine field of Corn, the joy of the other is like the joy of him that is the owner of this field of Corn.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Hypocrites joy in the Word after the outward man, as apprehending moſt of the duties equitable and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and many of them advantageous to a mans Eſtate, credit and relations, but a right hearer <hi>delights in the Law of God after the inner man, Rom.</hi> 7.22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 True joy is accompanied with fear, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.11. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him with trembling;</hi> and alſo righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>The Kingdom of God conſiſteth in righteouſneſs, peace and joy of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> It's otherwiſe in hypocrites, their joy is accompanied with love of ſome Luſt.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Practiſe Chriſtian conference, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. The godly when they met together ſpake often one to another, of the providence of God.

<pb n="578" facs="tcp:171178:295"/>Cavillers in <hi>Pauls</hi> time were out of Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Where is the diſputer of this world?</hi> Take we heed they be not now in the Church.

                     <hi>V.</hi> 29. <hi>For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the Scribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is the effect of Chriſt his ſermon, that the hearers were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine. Doctrine hath ſometimes that effect among hearers that are not ſoul-ſavingly wrought upon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.54. the people were aſtoniſhed and cried out, <hi>Whence hath this man this wiſedome? Is not this the Carpenters ſon?</hi> Chriſt is not compared with the old Prophets whom they had never ſeen, but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Scribes, the interpreters of the Law, whom they heard daily. Theſe taught frivolous trifles and vain rites of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pots and cups, and Corban, but Chriſt taught with authority.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 He taught ſerious things, as how to be builded upon a ſolid foundation, when ſtorms came, who were bleſſed perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Chriſt taught by his life, as well as by his doctrine. It is a long way to holineſs by precepts, it is ſhort by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As we ſpeak the Goſpel ſo let us live it. People loath
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:171178:297"/>doctrine when the man that preaches it is wicked, people ſay if it be neceſſary to live as he ſaith, why doth he not live ſo himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Chriſt taught with a mighty zeal and fervor, and not coldly: ſuch teachers were <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.14. <hi>John Baptiſt, Who came in the Spirit and power of Elias, Epaphras, Col.</hi> 4.12. There is in doctrine not onely the light of the Word, but the fire of the Word. The Word is called a <hi>fiery Law, Deut.</hi> 33.2. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was a burning and a ſhining light, <hi>John</hi> 5.35. when he taught, the people they cried out, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> And ſo did the ſouldiers, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.12, 13. And ſo when <hi>Peter</hi> preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. the people cried out, what ſhall we do? The Word is fire, he that delivers it coldly delivers it otherwiſe then it is. Were it not ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, when an houſe were on fire, to ſay, Friends we had beſt get water to quench it, or elſe all our goods will be burnt; but when a houſe is a fire, we cry fire, fire, for the Lords ſake bring water, bring Ladders, Buckets, untile the Houſe, cut down the Beams, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here's the affection of the Word; ſo ſhould a Preacher ſtir up the people, the fire of Gods vengeance is coming, oh bring the tears of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The affection of the truth muſt be delivered, as well as the body of the truth; the Word is compared to fire, which is the moſt piercing element of all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The Scribes taught as the interpreters of the Law, but Chriſt as a Prophet ſent from heaven; as when a Conſtable comes in the name of the Prince, I charge you in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Name, ſo Preachers when they ſpeak to men, ſhould ſpeak to their conſciences, I charge you in the name of the God of heaven that you leave off your pride, lying, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Preach Chriſt crucified in a crucified phraſe, <hi>not with wiſdome of words, leſt the croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect.</hi> Beſides, the wit of man hides the power of the Word, and he that receives the Word upon eloquent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement, will be drawn to leave it when he hears greater
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:171178:297"/>eloquence perſwading thereto. It's the miſery of the times, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the deluder of wits, ſhould in moſt Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be heeded rather then Chriſt the Prophet of his Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Chriſt came home to the Conſciences of men, and ſo <hi>Paul; We commend our ſelves to every mans conſcience as in the ſight of God.</hi> He ſpeaks with authority that ſpeaks to the conſcience. <hi>Know ye not the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. Matth. 23.33. <hi>O generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 Chriſt came with authority, not onely as an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law of God, but as being himſelf <hi>a Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come from heaven,</hi> John 3.11. <hi>We ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen.</hi> Alſo <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32. <hi>He that cometh from heaven is above all, and what he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifieth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7 Chriſt came with authority, in the convincing of ſouls for ſin. It's one great work of the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.10. Hence <hi>Micah</hi> 3.8. <hi>I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgement, and of might, to declare unto</hi> Jacob <hi>his tranſgreſsion, and to</hi> Iſrael <hi>his ſin.</hi> Hence he ſpares nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince, Prophet or Prieſt, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12. The Word ſhould come as a thunder-clap to the heart of the ſinner, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Magus, I perceive thou art in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and bond of iniquity: ye have been the betrayers and murderers of the Son of God, Acts</hi> 2.36. As <hi>Nazianzen, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi> 20. ſaid of <hi>Baſil, His word was like thunder, his life like lightning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 He taught with authority, in preaching to the life; as a picture is well drawn when its drawn as to life, ſo a preacher muſt preach as to life: to preach of heaven, hell, death and judgement, as if they were before us, to preach out the wrath of God that the ſinner may apprehend it as a burning fire, to ſet forth the uglineſs of ſin that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as black as hell, to ſet forth the particular excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:171178:298"/>of Chriſt that the ſoul may ſay, <hi>Whither is thy beloved gone, that we may ſeek him with thee?</hi> To ſet forth the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſs of judgement, that the ſinner may be afraid to live one hour in ſuch a condition as he would be afraid to dye in.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 In not ſparing perſons of the greateſt quality, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, Pilate,</hi> the High Prieſts, Lawyers, Scribes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt denounces woe upon woe upon them; <hi>Woe unto you Phariſees, woe unto you Scribes, woe unto you Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> Luk. 11.42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 50, 51, 52. <hi>Nor did he fear the faces of the Mighty,</hi> Jer, 1.10, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 He taught with authority, not onely in preſſing powerful doctrine, but alſo did move upon their hearts by the working of his Spirit, that their hearts were all on fire in hearing of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.32. <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us while he opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> So <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Chriſt taught vvith authority, becauſe himſelf vvas deeply affected vvith the things vvhich he taught. It is not a thundring voice, nor vehement enforcements from natural ſtrength that proves povverfulneſs of doctrine, but it much tends to authority, both in prayer and preaching, that the heart of the preacher be firſt vvrought upon, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in private betvvixt God and his ſoul, or in publick: affections in the preacher beget affections in the hearer, and after an unperceiveable manner dravv them over. So Chriſt vvhen he preached to multitudes, ſometimes he put on bovvels of pity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.37. ſometimes grief and vveeping, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41. compared vvith <hi>ver.</hi> 48. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.35, 38. compared vvith <hi>ver.</hi> 45.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Chriſt taught vvith authority, becauſe he knevv none could charge ſin upon him; ſo ſhall a teacher that lives a blameleſs converſation, and knovvs that no man can charge evil upon him, he hath authority in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but if he be covetous, or proud, or vain, he looſes
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:171178:298"/>that authorative povver (vvhich God hath given him) in the hearts of hearers, <hi>Titus,</hi> 2.15. <hi>Rebuke with all authority, let no man deſpiſe thee, q. d.</hi> if thou doeſt any thing unvvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to render thy ſelf deſpicable, thy authority vvill be loſt.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 By a vehement preſſing and urging the commands upon the conſciences of men, vvithall denouncing threats againſt the ungodly, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.26, 27. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.21. to <hi>ver.</hi> 27. ſo ſhould a preacher preſs the commands upon perſons, I command you in the name of the Lord Jeſus, that you be not proud, paſſionate, greedy after the world: So <hi>John Baptiſt, Matth.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. <hi>Now the ax is laid to the root of the tree,</hi> bring forth fruit, elſe you vvill be throvvn into the fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> See a duty in faithful preachers, 1 To teach vvith authority remembring vvhoſe Embaſſadours they are, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To maintain the authority vvhich the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. maintain it both by life and doctrine, by preaching povverfully and living holily. Hovv povverfull vvas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his preaching? See <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To the Brethren to obey that Word that comes with authority to their conſciences, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And not as the Scribes]</hi> Whoſe teaching was either tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary, as the waſhing of pots, and cups, and hands, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tombs of Prophets, making broad phylacteries, but for things tending to mortification they ſpake not at all, or very ſuperficially, or their teaching was formal. When they ſpake of the love of God and other duties, they ſpake of them without zeal and feeling, and therefore they were not like to affect others when themſelves were not firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The Orator that moves his hearers muſt firſt be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="586" facs="tcp:171178:299"/>
                  <p>Or their teaching was hypocritical, binding heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon others, they themſelves not touching them with one of their fingers.</p>
                  <p>Or their teaching was in generals, and confounded.</p>
                  <p>Contrarily Chriſt, 1 For matter, he teaches weighty points, as concerning true bleſſedneſs and the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them that mean to attain it, concerning a holy life free from ſcandal, concerning love to enemies, alms, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, faſting, placing treaſure in heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For manner. Chriſt ſpeaks with fervency and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: fire begets fire, the burning affection in Chriſt which he had in ſpeaking, makes the hearts of his Diſciples burn in hearing, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 For method. Chriſt ſpeaks diſtinctly, firſt to one point and then to another, whereas they confounded what they ſpake. Method is the mother of memory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Chriſt in his doctrine was impartial, he ſpared none. Many ſpeak truth to the common people ſuffering all things, not to them whom they fear will perſecute them, to whom eſpecially it is to be ſpoken. He that looks upon mens perſons will be terrified with the ſhow of titles and dignities.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 He preached fearleſly: he feared no mans angry looks. Let not faithfull Preachers expect glory but ignominy and contempt, not wealth but poverty, violence, priſons and death, as <hi>Michaiah</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and when others ſhall be caſt into hell, ſuch ſhall have place in heaven. As <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath his Electors, the Turk his Princes, ſo our King hath his Miniſters. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is a Prince Elector, ſo <hi>Irenaeus, Quadratus</hi> are Princes and Counts, <hi>Luth. Tom.</hi> 3.495. let us not then fear the oppoſition of men: how great oppoſition did <hi>Noah</hi> ſuffer in his miniſtry for hundreds of years? A Preacher muſt be <hi>vir rixarum,</hi> a man of ſtrife.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 He was not vain-glorious, but ſtill ſought the glory of his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38, 39. ſo let faithfull Preachers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:171178:299"/>ſay, I began not to preach the Goſpel that the world ſhould honour me, and I will not ceaſe from preaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the worlds reproach.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 He was in his Miniſtry convictive of gain-ſayers, yet did he not, according to the guiſe of the times, tye up his convincing arguments to ſyllogiſms in mood and figure, but he brought unanſwerable reaſon. Without this gift Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will be waſted and ſcattered. See <hi>Titus</hi> 1.9.</p>

               <p>SOmetimes Chriſt goes from miracles to doctrine, but here, having laid down his doctrine, he comes in this Chapter to confirm it by miracles. Before he began his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he healed all ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.23. that he might make way for his doctrine. For doubtleſs the miracles Chriſt and his Apoſtles did, were a great cauſe why their doctrine in ſo great meaſure was believed, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.6. <hi>The people with one accord gave heed unto thoſe things which</hi> Philip <hi>ſpake, hearing and ſeeing the miracles which he did.</hi> And now Chriſt, when his ſermon was ended on the Mount; he went down and the multitudes followed him, before whom he wrought ſundry miracles.</p>

<pb n="588" facs="tcp:171178:300"/>ſome for loaves, <hi>John</hi> 6.27. Chriſt hath multitudes of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, but few that follow him for a right end. Look we to the end why we follow Chriſt, whether it be for glory and earthly praiſe or profit, or whether it be for himſelf, in all conditions, even in adverſity, perſecution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Let him deny himſelf and take up his croſs and follow me.</hi> Virgin ſouls follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. yea though to priſon, baniſhment, death: the world pretend to follow Chriſt, but it's at a diſtance, always with the exception of the croſs.</p>

               <p>Leproſie is abundance of burnt choler and ſalt phlegm diffuſed from the Liver all over the body, breaking out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a filthy ſcab or ſcurf.

Yet in a miraculous manner ſome Lepers have been cured, as <hi>Miriam, Num.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Naaman,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean]</hi> Here is the profeſſion of his faith. Of no Prince or Potentate can this be affirmed, ſave of God himſelf, no nor of any Diſciple or Apoſtle, for they did not do Miracles when they would, but when God would. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. onely of God is that true which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>cap.</hi> 42.2. <hi>I know thou canſt do every thing.

Photinus</hi> taught that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was meer Man and not God, whoſe will onely is omnipotent; <hi>Arrius</hi> taught that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was leſs than the Father, and therefore did not command, but onely received the commands of the Father; <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> taught that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not true but onely imaginary fleſh, and therefore could neither touch nor be touched. <hi>Chriſt</hi> confutes all theſe in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be thou clean]</hi> Here's the Divinity of Chriſt: men are wont to command actions, but to make things to be by commanding them to be, is onely divine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light; Let the Earth be created, and it was ſo.</hi>

                  <hi>Immediately his Leproſie was cleanſed]</hi> With a touch of Chriſts hand, and with a word of his mouth; he touched him, that the cure might not ſeem to come by chance, but that it onely came from himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To ſhew the mercy and condeſcention of Chriſt, that did not diſdain to touch a leprous perſon, much more in taking Leproſie of ſin on him, and making us one body him.</p>
               <p>In that this Leproſie was cured immediately, there came came no ſpace of time nor no outward mean, betwixt the command of Chriſt and the work of Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>And</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſaith unto him, See thou tell no man, but go thy way, Shew thy ſelf to the Prieſt, and offer the Gift that</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded for a teſtimony unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See thou tell no man]</hi> There are ſundry cauſes why Chriſt enjoyns him ſilence.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Chriſt did not forbid him to tell it at any time, but that he ſhould not tell it till he had ſhewed himſelf to the Prieſts, leſt the Prieſts hearing of the cure ſhould malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly report that the Leper was not truly healed, according to the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. wherein the Prieſt was to judg of Leproſie, and therefore in the Text it follows, <hi>Go ſhew thy ſelf to the Prieſt.</hi> This Miracle fell out in <hi>Galilee, Mark</hi> 1.39. and the Prieſts were at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the Prieſts were called out of the City that they might judg of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
               <p>There were other cauſes, as, 1 For modeſty ſake, and to avoid boaſting.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For not ſpeaking forth that in word which ſpake forth it ſelf in deed, in his whole body the Leproſie being removed.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe the fit time was not come; therefore the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers zeal was diſorderly in publiſhing that Chriſt would have kept ſilent, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.45.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Leſt hereby Chriſt ſhould ſtir up the envy and hatred of the Phariſees againſt him, and ſo be forced to go from the City, not having an opportunity to preach the Goſpel. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.45. So that Chriſt could no more openly enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, but was forced to remain in deſert places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But go thy way, ſhew thy ſelf to the Prieſt]</hi> Chriſt bids him ſhew himſelf to the Prieſt, 1 Becauſe the ceremonies were yet in force. Now the ceremonial command was, that the Leper ſhould ſhow himſelf to the Prieſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the healed Leper might teſt fie his thankfulneſs to God for ſo great a benefit, by bringing a thank-offering, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.1, to 9.</p>
               <pb n="592" facs="tcp:171178:302"/>
               <p n="3">3 To draw the Prieſts either to faith in Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for their oppoſition againſt him, or elſe that they might be inexcuſable: hence theſe words follow, for a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony unto them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 To get a teſtimonial of his cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And offer the gift which Moſes commanded]</hi> See what this was, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. It was an oblation or thank-offering to God for his cleanſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For a teſtimony unto them]</hi> As 1 That they might be inexcuſable if they would not embrace Chriſt for the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the receiving of the gift may be a continual teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the Prieſts that the Leproſie was perfectly healed; if they through malice, ſhould in time to come go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deny it, they could not ſay ſuch an one was not cured, for whom they had offered a thank-offering to God. Chriſt would have them that were his adverſaries to be the firſt witneſſes of his miracles.</p>
               <p>Beſides it was that he might be reſtored to the ſociety of men, from whoſe company he had been ſevered.</p>
               <p>But that from hence Papiſts may wire-draw the Law of their confeſſion, making Leproſie to be allegorically ſins, and the Prieſts the knowers hereof, is a vain thing; for what Honour thoſe Prieſts had Chriſt alone challenges to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who alone knows ſpiritual Leproſie, and is worthy to whom we ſhould offer the gift of our cleanſing.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſin is like Leproſie, 1 For loathſomneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5. 2 For ſmell; a Leper from ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humors cannot but ſmell. So ſinners ſtink, though perhaps not one to another, as naſty priſoners in the goal, yet to thoſe that come out of the freſh Ayr; ſo though wicked men ſtink not one to another, yet to God and Saints they do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.3. <hi>They are altogether become ſtinking,</hi> as the margin renders it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For Hereditarineſs as the Leproſie is conveyed from
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:171178:302"/>Father to Son, ſo is original defilement, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.</p>
               <p n="4">4 For excommunicableneſs. Leproſie ſeparated, not onely from divine ſervice, but alſo from ſociety with men; ſo ſin lived in ſeparates betwixt God and us, and ſeparates from communion of Saints, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="5">5 For contagion. Leproſie was very infectious, ſo is ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</hi> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here's the difference, the Leper proclaimed his unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that men might take heed of being infected by him, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.45. which ſinners will not.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Leproſie creeps from one place to another till the whole body be overſpread with it; ſo doth corruption or ſin, it creeps from the heart to the members of the body, and faculties of the ſoul, ſo that <hi>from the crown of the head, to the ſole of the foot there is nothing but wounds, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and putrifying ſores,</hi> Iſa. 1.6.</p>
               <p>Though in a tropological ſence ſin may thus be reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to Leproſie, yet Leproſie properly taken is meant, and no Popiſh inference of Prieſtly power can thence be deduced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> No perſon whatſoever, how vile ſoever, by bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtemper is hereby kept off from worſhipping God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He that believes that God will do him good, muſt alſo be convinced of the power of God, that God can do him good.</p>
               <p n="3">3 All cleanſing from bodily diſeaſes proceeds from the will of God as the primitive cauſe thereof. <hi>I will, be thou clean.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 From the fixed confidence he had in Chriſt, <hi>Speak the Word onely, and my ſervant ſhall be healed. ver.</hi> 8.

               <p>Amplified from a threefold effect, 1 A propheſie of the calling in of the Gentiles, of whom this Centurion was as a firſt fruit, <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when Jeſus was entered into Capernaum there came unto him a Centurion]</hi> The former miracle was done near to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> this in the city. A Centurion was one that had a hundred ſouldiers under him, or ſometimes more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Came unto him] Obj. Luk.</hi> 7.3.<note place="margin">V. de</note> Its ſaid that he ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt the Elders of the Jews to beſeech him to heal his ſervant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> After the Centurion had ſent the Jews and his friends to ſupplicate Chriſt, then laſtly himſelf came to him to meet Chriſt, whether for Honour ſake, or the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his ſervant was in; unleſs we anſwer that he came and ſupplicated, not by himſelf, but by his meſſengers; for that which is done by the authority of another he himſelf is ſaid to do it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.3. ſo Chriſt is ſaid to Baptize and not Baptize; to Baptize, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.22. not to Baptize, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. which may eaſily be reconciled: he Baptized by his Diſciples, though he did not Baptize in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. We ſay ſuch a man built this houſe, though it was not built but by his ſervants. Hence <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.10. its ſaid they that were ſent returning to the houſe found the ſervant whole that had been ſick. That which <hi>Matthew</hi> more haſtily ſets down, <hi>Luke</hi> doth more fully, the Spirit intending to make one perfect Hiſtory out of the four Evangeliſts. So that this is the ſame ſtory with that in <hi>Luke,</hi> as appears by the agreements in many things, and the few diverſities.</p>
               <p>In that he was a Centurion, ſee that no mans calling hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him from being godly. This Centurion, his faith was ſeen in acknowledging one God, in building the Jews a Synagogue, which could not be without much envy and hatred, and in his care of his ſervant, and in his believing profeſſion he made to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My ſervant lyeth at home ſick of the Palſey]</hi> The Palſey is the looſening of the ſinews; one half part of the body is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſed,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:171178:304"/>motion and ſenſe being intercepted from them. When this is in one part of the body it's called a Palſey, when it's in the whole body it is called an Apoplexy.</p>

                  <hi>My ſervant]</hi> A leſſon to rich men not to turn away their ſervants when they are ſick, but to ſeek the beſt way they can for their relief. See a judgement of God on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.13. A certain <hi>Amalekite</hi> turned away his ſervant becauſe he fell ſick, and this ſervant ſo caſt out, God made inſtrumental to diſcover the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> ſo that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> deſtroyed them. Yea, which is more, to ſeek the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their ſervants. By ſuch care Maſters ſhow to their ſervants they will not onely do things juſt and equal, having a Maſter in heaven, (for it's equal that the ſervant ſerving his Maſter ſincerely in his health, the Maſter ſhould keep him in his ſickneſs) but alſo they will let their ſervants ſee, that they do not onely reſpect their own good, but their ſervants benefit, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.12, 13, 14, 15. eſpecially if they ſhall withall have a care of their ſervants ſpirituall good, whiles they are more offended for their ſins againſt God, then for the neglect of duty towards themſelves.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here is the humility and condeſcention of Chriſt, that he diſdained not to come to viſit a poor ſervant, we ſhould not diſdain to viſit the meaneſt, <hi>John</hi> 13.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>The Centurion anſwered and ſaid, Lord, I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that thou ſhouldeſt come under my roof, but ſpeak the word onely and my ſervant ſhall be healed.</hi>

                  <hi>V.</hi> 9. <hi>For I alſo am a man under authority,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Centurion ſpoke this to Chriſt by his friends, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.6. after by himſelf, as <hi>Matthew</hi> ſets down, for civility required that he ſhould go to meet Chriſt hearing of his coming. The humility of a ſervant is more dark, but when a King, a Nobleman, a Teacher, a Rich man is humble, their humility ſhines as the Sun and Moon. Let ſuch a Magiſtrate ſay, Ah who am I? Why ſhould I ſet my ſelf before others? unleſs that a heavier burthen of government lies on me,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:171178:305"/>and therefore a greater account of my Office is to be given. <hi>Luth. in</hi> 41. <hi>cap. Gen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here was one effect of his faith, that whereas ſouldiers are naturally ſo lifted up, he was ſo humble: ſo we finde ſundry of the Saints, the more gracious the more humble. <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Agur, Prov.</hi> 30.2. <hi>Iſaiah. c.</hi> 6.5. <hi>John Baptiſt, Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Peter, Luk.</hi> 5.8. Hence the Centurion ſaith, neither thought I my ſelf worthy to come unto thee, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.7. It's like, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his conſcience told him he had been a worſhipper of falſe Gods, partly becauſe the Jews refuſed communion and company with him, but eſpecially becauſe he ſaw the vileneſs of his own corrupt nature, and the exceeding glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious holineſs in Chriſt, hence he ſaith I am not worthy. Where there is moſt grace commonly there is moſt ſenſe of unworthineſs and true humility, the ſhow of that this man had in truth more deceives the world then any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſpeak the word onely]</hi> The Centurion having heard of the fame of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.23. when he healed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and alſo of the cleanſing of the Leper, who publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the cure, he ſaith, ſpeak the word onely.</p>
               <p>My word is the word of a man, thy word is the Word of the Son of God; my word hath power over men under me, thy Word hath power over all ſorts of diſeaſes, yea ſuch as are incurable, yea over death, I am under the power of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, thou art ſubject to no power; being thou art God therefore ſpeak the word onely.</p>
               <p>As his wiſdome was ſeen in that he ſaw the Godhead ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the veil of fleſh, his humility, that he judg'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy that Chriſt ſhould come under his roof, ſo here is his faith, that he ſaith, <hi>ſpeak the word onely:</hi> learn that our faith go upon a word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5, 6. thou being abſent canſt cure him by a word of thy mouth, therefore there is no need of thy bodily preſence, but <hi>ſpeak the word onely and my ſervant ſhall be whole.</hi> God ſpeaks

               <p>Here we have the commendation of the Centurions faith; <hi>[He marvelled]</hi> Chriſt did not marvel as God, for no new unexpected thing can befall him, but it may befall Chriſt in his humane nature, having like affections with us.

<pb n="600" facs="tcp:171178:306"/>ignorant of, as of the Day of Judgment, the time of Figs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Marvel is when our expectation is exceeded. Chriſt marvelled at all his graces, as his Humility, Devotion in building a Synagogue, his Faith. Chriſt doth not admire the buildings of the Temple, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.1. nor the Princes of the World, but the graces of the Spirit in one that had ſo little means.

               <p>
                  <hi>I have not found ſo great faith, no not in</hi> Iſrael] The greatneſs of his faith is ſeen, 1 That he believed ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon ſo ſmall means. 2 That he believed Chriſts Word; 1 His Word of Command. 2 His Word of Promiſe. 3 That he believed without a Miracle, <hi>John</hi> 4.48.

                  <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>When the even was come, they brought unto him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that were poſſeſſed with devils, and he caſt out the ſpirits with his word, and healed all that were ſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the effect that followed upon Chriſt his curing <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother. There were in Chriſt his time many poſſeſſed with devils, that the power of Chriſt might be ſeen in healing of them, he cured them by laying his hands on them, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.40.</p>
               <p>Now if you ask what theſe perſons that were poſſeſſed with devils were?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was in likelihood no other but madneſs, <hi>John</hi> 10.20. <hi>He hath a devil and is mad;</hi> ſo that theſe perſons laboured not of ſimple dotage, but of raving madneſs. So alſo lunatick perſons that had the falling ſickneſs monethly afflicting them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Have mercy on my ſon, becauſe
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:171178:310"/>he is lunatick, for oft times he falleth into the fire,</hi> compared with <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Jeſus rebuked the devil and it departed out of him;</hi> ſo it appears this lunatick man was a daemoniak. See <hi>Luke</hi> 9.39. Speaking of the ſame Lunatick perſon, he ſaith, <hi>lo a ſpirit taketh him, and it teareth him that he fometh alſo,</hi> v. 42. <hi>The devil threw him down and tare him, and Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the unclean ſpirit and healed the childe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, it's ſtrange how theſe Daemoniaks ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in Jury, when we hear of none ſuch in other nations. Theſe the Heathens called <hi>Larvati,</hi> q.d. <hi>Larvis acti,</hi> moved or affrighted with devils, alſo <hi>Cerriti quaſi Cereriti,</hi> ſmitten of <hi>Ceres,</hi> who was the goddeſs of Corn, in plain Engliſh a drunken man, who was mad drunk or lion drunk, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Menechmus</hi> in <hi>Plautus</hi> feigns himſelf mad, the Phyſician who was ſent to cure him asks, whether he were <hi>larvatus</hi> or <hi>cerritus.</hi> And ſo <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> 2. <hi>Apol. ad Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin.</hi> counts Daemoniaks and mad men all one.

We ſee he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all that were ſick, none excepted, if they came to him; alſo all ſorts of diſeaſes, as Leproſie, Palſey, Bloody flux, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Chriſt did this to prove himſelf to be the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias. Matth.</hi> 11.4.5. <hi>Go ſhew</hi> John <hi>what ye ſee and hear; the Blinde receive their ſight, the Lame walk, the Lepers are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi> and though the Apoſtles wrought ſtrange cures on the bodies of men, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.11, 12. ſo that diſeaſes depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the ſick by their aprons and handkercheifs:

                     <item>2 Chriſt had this power at all times, to heal whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he would, ſo had not they, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. for then would not <hi>Paul</hi> have left <hi>Trophimus</hi> ſick at <hi>Miletum,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.20.</item>

                     <item>3 The miracles the Apoſtles did were ſometimes for the hurt of men, as <hi>Peter</hi> in the deſtruction of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſmiting <hi>Elymas</hi> with blindneſs, but all Chriſts miracles and cures tended to the benefit of men.</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was onely a permiſſion whereby Chriſt kept back the power that was able to hinder them, not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>This ſhould embolden us in all our maladies to come to Chriſt. He that had ſuch bowels on earth is not without bowels in heaven; he that would do ſo much for <hi>Malchus,</hi> one of them that came to take him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.51. who ſet on his ear and healed him when <hi>Peter</hi> cut it off, will he not do as much or more for his children in their maladies?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by</hi> Eſaias <hi>the Prophet, ſaying, himſelf took our infirmities and bare our ſickneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the final cauſe, to wit, the fulfilling the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Eſaias [He took our infirmities, and bare our ſickneſſes]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The diſeaſes of our ſoul, to which <hi>Eſaias</hi> hath reſpect, <hi>Eſai</hi> 53.4. He bore our griefs and carried our ſorrows, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>He himſelf bore our ſins in his own body on the tree, Eſai</hi> 53.6. <hi>John</hi> 1.29. <hi>He takes away the ſins of the world, Col.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The diſeaſes of our body which flow from ſin; Chriſt bore theſe, not by taking them upon him, for Chriſt was never ſick; he took not the paſſions which were proper to this or that man, but thoſe which were common to the whole nature. Chriſt was never ſick; ſickneſſe ariſes from the unfit or unequal temperature of the humours, or from intemperance of labour, ſtudy, but none of theſe were in Chriſt, he had no ſin and therefore no ſickneſs, ſo that Chriſt took not our ſins by taking them upon him, but out of compaſſion he took them away and reſtored the ſick to health. The end why Chriſt cured the bodily diſeaſes of
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:171178:311"/>perſons, as, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2. was that they might ſeek to him for the healing of their ſouls, as in the blinde man, <hi>John</hi> 9.5, 6.</p>
               <p>So that as the living Goat had the ſins of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> laid upon him, and carried them into a Wilderneſs and land not inhabited, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.21, 22. So Chriſt took our ſins and the puniſhments flowing from them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them into a Land of forgetfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>In that Chriſt took our weakneſſes, learn, 1 To bear the weakneſſes of others. 1 As in journeys ſtrong Travellers bear the burthens of the weak, ſo ſhould we, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1. <hi>We that are ſtrong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 All infirmities are burthens to a gracious heart, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. let them be part of thy burthen alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Many infirmities may be in a dear childe of God,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.2. Mark 9.23.</note> as paſſion in <hi>Jonas,</hi> unbelief in <hi>Thomas,</hi> fearfulneſſe in <hi>Peter,</hi> to keep us from admiration of their perſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4 As thy brother is overtaken to day, ſo mayeſt thou be to morrow, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. As often as we behold ſinners we had need to bewail our ſelves in them, becauſe we have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len or may fall into the like if God leave us. God hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many great men to fall, from <hi>Adam</hi> to this day, to ſhew mans weakneſſe, and that they might not become lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their name.</p>
               <p n="5">5 If envy did not blinde thee, thou mighteſt ſee many good things in him as well as infirmities.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If any man ſhall raiſe his comfort from other mens failings, to ſeem to himſelf holy becauſe he ſees imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in his brethren, this will be no true comfort in a day of trial, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Beware of having a mean and baſe eſteem of any of the Saints of God, becauſe of their infirmities, ſo as to ſet them at nought, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. No man caſts away his noſe becauſe it abounds with impure flegme, and is as it were the ſink of the brain; ſo the weak in time of weakneſs are part
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:171178:311"/>of Chriſt's Kingdom, who therefore are not to be caſt away, but to be healed and raiſed up. <hi>Luth. in Pſalm</hi> 90.</p>
               <p n="2">2 See the goodneſs and mercy of Chriſt that took our infirmities, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 130.3. <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldeſt be extreme to mark what is done amiſs, who ſhould ſtand? but there is compaſsion that he may be feared. Matth.</hi> 12.20. <hi>He will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench ſmoaking Flax.</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace in the ſoul doth not waſte corruption all at once, but by degrees, <hi>John</hi> 15.2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. Hence God is gracious in purging the ſoul to bring forth more grace and leſs ſin, and renewing the inward man every day.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Trial, whether thy ſins be Infirmities, as, 1 When they are committed againſt the purpoſe of the heart; ſo <hi>Peter</hi> in his denial of Chriſt, what hope had we, if <hi>Peter</hi> had not denied Chriſt and all the Apoſtles been offended, if <hi>Moſes, Aaron, David,</hi> had not fallen? by theſe Examples God comforts ſinners. If thou haſt fallen, return, the gate of mercy is open for thee, thou that knoweſt no evil by thy ſelf, do not preſume, but let both truſt in my grace and mercy. <hi>Luth. in Gen.</hi> 38.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When we diſallow the evil we do, and groan under it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. when others hearts are hardened under evil, thine is ſenſible.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When though thou falleſt into ſin thou walkeſt not in any ſinfull courſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. though there be many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in holy Duties and ſudden breakings out of the heart into evil, yet is it not allowed.</p>
               <p n="4">4 When a ſoul is fallen into ſin and hath loſt Gods countenance, he cannot be quiet untill the Lord return with the ſenſe of his love, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.8, 12. there can be no ſins of infirmity properly, but where grace is, for the ſins of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men are Preſumptions. Good men, having taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſweetneſs in God, they will not change their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor reſt content without God. Saints infirmities, as <hi>Davids</hi> ſins, complaints, fears, more comfort me than their
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:171178:312"/>heroical actions, as his killing <hi>Goliath,</hi> the Bear and Lion: I cannot imitate theſe, but the other greatly comfort me. <hi>Luth. in Gen.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Comfort to Saints under Infirmities. There are ſome invincible Infirmities cleaving unto Saints in this World, as dulneſs, forgetfulneſs, privy pride, ſelf-ſeeking, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs, wandrings in duty, backwardneſs to Chriſtian provocation, inordinate care, hardneſs of heart, vain fears, ſlightneſs in Gods ſervice. Saints, partly from divine light ſhining in them, which, like the light of the Sun, ſhews the ſmalleſt mote, partly from tenderneſs of conſcience renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſmiting them for the ſmalleſt ſin, are upon ſight of their infirmities apt to be diſcouraged. Now to comfort thee remember Chriſt took thy infirmities; all thy ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, crookedneſs of heart, failing in holy duties, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.22. are taken away by Chriſt, that they ſhall never be imputed to thee. Such perſons alſo are invited to come to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. Satan in all weakneſſes is wont to preſent God as a Tyrant, or hard Maſter, or a ſevere Judg, but let us in Chriſt apprehend him as a Father, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.13. and Chriſt as a gracious Mediatour. And though a cloud of indignation may appear to the ſoul under a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet tarry a while and the cloud will be over. Yea, Chriſt alſo heals our infirmities, and that even by our falls, as Poyſon is driven out by Poyſon; for when he ſees his fall he is aſhamed and confounded, crying out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if Chriſt onely took my infirmities and weakneſs, what will become of my preſumptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt took both, and though the Word onely ſignifie weakneſs, yet muſt it be taken in a large ſenſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all wickedneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Terrour to ungodly men that have all their ſins lying upon them; Chriſt took not thy ſins: as the greateſt evil done by a childe of God ſhall not be charged upon them in
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:171178:312"/>the day of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. ſo the leaſt evil, yea, every evil wicked men do, ſhall be charged then on them, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14. Chriſt will deſtroy all ſuch as give not the kiſs of love, reverence, and ſubjection unto him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 18. <hi>Now when</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſaw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other ſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here's another ſtory of Chriſt, wherein two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 His command to make all things ready to carry him to the other ſide, that is, over the Lake of <hi>Geneſareth</hi> from <hi>Capernaum,</hi> occaſioned by the multitudes that preſſed upon him, whether to eſchew vain-glory, or whether (which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to) to preach the Goſpel unto other Cities.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The occurrences that fell out by the way, which were,</p>
               <p n="1">1 A certain Scribe or covetous Lawyer, thinking Chriſt to make a gain of his Miracles follows him, upon hope to learn the art of doing Miracles, that himſelf might make a gain or trade thereby, as <hi>Magus</hi> did, to whom Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>The birds of the air have neſts, &amp;c. v.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another Diſciple of Chriſt deſires leave to bury his father, to whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Let the dead bury their dead, v.</hi> 21, 22.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Occurrence, a great Tempeſt, <hi>v.</hi> 24. ſo that the ſhip was covered with waves, which is ſet forth from five cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1 From Chriſt his being aſleep in the ſtorm, till the Diſciples awaked him, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2 From the danger and fear of the Diſciples, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh, v.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3 From Chriſt his reprehenſion of them for their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, <hi>Why are ye fearfull, O ye of little faith,</hi> as to think that a ſhip wherein I am can be drowned?</p>
               <p n="4">4 From Chriſt his reprehending the Winde and Sea, and making a great calm, <hi>v.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The admiration of the paſſengers, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of man is this, that even the Windes and Seas obey him?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 19. <hi>A certain Scribe came unto him, ſaying, Maſter, I will follow thee whither ſoever thou goeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The large profeſſion of this Scribe ariſes from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the perſon; many cloſing in an outward comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with Chriſt, when they ſee themſelves miſtaken in the perſon, they fall off. He pretended to be taught of Chriſt as a Diſciple of his Maſter, but his intention was to get Riches by Chriſt; the profeſſion was ſuch as might befit the holieſt: thoſe Virgins <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goes.</hi> And <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 11.8. <hi>He went out after God, not knowing whither he went.</hi> But Chriſt ſees what his intention was. He that will univerſally follow Chriſt, muſt not be miſtaken in him, he muſt take Chriſt and Baniſhment, Reproach, Impriſonment as well as Chriſt, and Riches, Honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 20. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Air have Neſts, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt lets this Scribe ſee his miſtake, <hi>q. d.</hi> thou thinks one way or other I can make thee rich, but thou mayeſt know I abound not with worldly wealth. Men that are brought up in delicacy and Riches are not fit to follow me. Chriſt, in not having a certain dwelling place, ſhews what his Diſciples ſhould prepare for. <hi>Obj.</hi> But Chriſt having ſo many perſons whom he cured, and did good turns for, why doth he ſay, <hi>The Son of Man hath not where to lay his head? Anſw.</hi> Leſt this Scribe ſhould expect ſome great Reward from him, as a rich Maſter, Chriſt ſhews that what he had was from the kindneſs of others, and ſhould not enrich him as he expected. This ſhould bridle that inordinate deſire after Riches, whereunto even Profeſſours in this day do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, to learn to ſee that Chriſt is Portion enough if there were nothing with him, and nothing will ſatisfie thy ſoul without him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>Now, Chriſt being thus poor, it was not to commend to
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:171178:313"/>us voluntary Poverty, as if it were a ſtate of Perfection, but to teach us contentment in low conditions if caſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

               <p>And as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was called the ſon of man, to diſtinguiſh him from Angels (with whom he converſed) who appeared in the ſhape of a man, ſo Chriſt becauſe he was God, and the Son of God, when he ſpeaks of himſelf as Man, calls himſelf the Son of Man.</p>

                  <hi>Suffer me firſt]</hi> Here is another of Chriſt his Diſciples who would follow Chriſt, but it muſt be when his father was dead. Chriſt here ſhows that nothing ſhould be put before the obſervation of his commands, as being a matter of eternal concernment, nor muſt we uſe delay herein. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.60. Nor muſt we preferre ſervice to relations; as probably this man might pretend to ſerve his Father while he lived, or to bury him now dead, for ſome think his Father was now dead, and Chriſt comes to him at this time to comfort him in the want of that relation. However Chriſt called him to follow him, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.59. and he makes this excuſe: ſome think his father was old, and it would not be long firſt before he were dead.</p>
               <p>It was a moderate requeſt to go and perform the laſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of love, but Chriſt knew others could do it, and then matters of ſalvation are to be preferred before matters of comlineſs and decency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Jeſus ſaid unto him, Follow me]</hi> That is, let thy love be ſo to thy relations, that if Chriſt call thee thou mayeſt leave all for him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Matth</hi> 10.37.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bury their dead]</hi> Chriſt doth not condemn burying their dead friends, who, if godly, are buried in hope of a comfortable reſurrection, but hereby tells us that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hinders us from a right courſe, ſavours nothing but death, and that the unbelieving Jews, who were dead in ſins, might ſerve to bury this man when he was dead, he had ſome brethren or kindred who might do it alſo.</p>

               <p n="3">3 Every unbelieving man is no other then a dead man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. Not like the man that fell among the thieves dangerouſly wounded, but quite dead; dead we are by the ſin of our firſt parents, not onely temporally, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. but ſpiritually, as unable to do ſpiritual actions, as dead men are to do the actions of living men, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. As in natural death there is a ſeparation of the ſoul from the body, ſo in ſpiritual death there is a ſeparation of God from the ſoul.</p>
               <p>For the ſeat of this ſpiritual death, It is in the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>John</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. It is in the will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. It's in the conſcience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. It's in the affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But if men be naturally dead, why do you preach to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 The word ſpoken is a mean to bring them to life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. When the Spirit of Chriſt accompanies it, the miniſtry of the word is appointed to turn perſons <hi>from darkneſs to light, Acts</hi> 26.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Though men be naturally dead, yet, 1 Are they
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:171178:315"/>not without reaſon to conſider what is ſpoken, and upon what grounds. 2 Though they be dead, yet they may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to the means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But there are ſome inward workings in the hearts of natural men, as ſence of ſin, fear of puniſhment, thoughts of deliverance, wiſhes for heaven, therefore they are not dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe and much more may be in natural men, yet are they dead. As, in the generation of man, there are many fore-going diſpoſitions, which go before the induction of the form; ſo there are many fore-going actions preceding ſpiritual regeneration, as we ſee in thoſe converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36, 37, 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Man hath ſome reliques of knowledge, how then is he dead?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Every knowledge doth not ſuppoſe life, but that onely which affects the heart with affiance and love, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. The devils know much, remaining devils ſtill. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides mans natural knowledge makes him inexcuſable not ſalvable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Natural men have many excellent virtues in them, therefore they are not dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As the evil actions of good men redound not to their perſons to make their perſons evil, ſo the good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of evil men redound not to their perſons to make them righteous. Good works do not make a good man, but a good man makes or does good works: evil works do not make an evil man, but an evil man makes evil works. So that it behoves the perſon always to be good before all good works, and good works come from a good perſon, <hi>Luth. Tom.</hi> 1 <hi>Cat. fol.</hi> 469. Their vertues are like pictures without life. There are many natural men fine Schollers and Gentlemen, too good to go to hell, yet not good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to go to heaven, for they being in the fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God; becauſe they are not good trees they
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:171178:315"/>cannot bring forth good fruit; all their virtues are like flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon a dead mans carkaſſe, that may adorn it, and keep off the ſtink thereof, but cannot give life thereto.</p>
               <p>As in the fleſh of a beaſt ſome part of it is ſold at a great price, other of it is caſt away or little regarded, yet all is fleſh, ſo ſome works of the natural man are abhominable, and ſome are commendable, but all are but fleſh. There are ſeveral ſorts of madneſſe, ſome light and fooliſh, ſome more ſober and ſolemn, yet all is but madneſs; ſo in ſpiritual madneſs the lives of ſome natural men are ſober, grave, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, the lives of others are wilde and ranting, yet all are dead and mad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Natural men are not dead, becauſe they have ſome ſignes of Gods image in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There's a twofold image, 1 Natural, ſtanding in immortality, immateriality, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>He that ſheds mans blood by man ſhall his blood be ſhed, for in the image of God made he him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 A ſupernatural image, conſiſting in righteouſneſs and holineſs. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>You have put on the new man, which is created in knowledge after the image of him that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him.</hi> The former image may be in natural men, not the latter.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 When men are loathſome. A dead body how adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoever is loathſome, yea though our neareſt friend. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> when <hi>Sarah</hi> was dead ſaid, <hi>Bury her out of my ſight,</hi> Gen. 23.4. ſo are all dead men to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.5. ſo are they to Gods people, ſo far as they are renewed.</p>

We muſt not be too ſtrict to limit young converts in their profeſſions (to a right judging of the work of grace) either to the time of their converſion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that, or to the promiſe that ſuſtained them in the hour of converſion.

                  <p>Yet where there are promiſes made over to the ſoul in the hour of converſion, which the ſoul well remembers, and wherein it found the ſenſe of Gods love in pardon, it tends ſo much the more to manifeſt ſpiritual life; which if they were truly ſo made over, and were not deluſions, they were accompanied with the forenamed diſpoſition of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all luſts and enjoyments for Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="10">10 All our motions in Religion are meerly artificial without this ſpiritual life, as in <hi>Joas</hi> ſo long as <hi>Jehoiada</hi> lived, and <hi>Jehu</hi> when <hi>Jonadab</hi> lookt upon his zeal, both of them ſeemed to be forward; and many others when buoy'd up with praiſe and benefits of profit, pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo <hi>Sichem</hi> in receiving Circumciſion; ſo many men do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things from conviction of natural conſcience, fear of Hell, ſhame among men, expectation of death, which are like wheels ſet a moving by a ſpring, which when the ſpring is down the motion ceaſeth.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here's a third occurrence in Chriſts journey over the Lake of <hi>Genezareth,</hi> that a ſtorm aroſe; this Lake is called a Sea for the greatneſs of it.</p>
                  <p>This ſtorm came, 1 To ſhew forth the power of Chriſt
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:171178:319"/>in aſſwaging it, who hereby ſhewed himſelf Lord of windes and ſtorms.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To awaken the Diſciples of Chriſt, who though not bodily aſleep, yet might be too ſecure. Secure perſons are much awakened in a ſtorm at ſea, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 107.26.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That thereby Chriſt might take occaſion to reprove their unbelief.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That the Diſciples and Paſſengers might, from his commanding the ſtorm, the more believe in him.</p>
                  <p>This ſtorm may alluſively point out the ſtorms in the hearts of Believers and in the Churches, which it is our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by caſting out any thing that hazards the Ship, or helps on the ſtorm, as <hi>Jonahs</hi> Mariners did, whether luſt or enjoyment. Storms commonly ariſe againſt Chriſt and his Diſciples, the Devil and World are the Sea that ſtirs up theſe Tempeſts. And as the Ship here was covered with waves, ſo it's the end of the Devil and World to ſink the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But he was aſleep]</hi> 1 By reaſon of his labour in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and journey he ſlept. 2 To ſhew forth the truth of his humane nature. Some think the Devil ſtirred up this ſtorm, hoping thereby to drown Chriſt and his Diſciples, as he had deſtroyed <hi>Jobs</hi> children: but Satan hath no power ſave what is given to him, though his will was full enough for ſuch a miſchief.</p>
                  <p>Yet though he ſlept in his humane nature, he was awake in his Deity, that the Diſciples being in danger might cry unto him more fervently, and be helped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 25. <hi>And his Diſciples came to him, and awoke him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord, ſave us we periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here was the weakneſs of their faith, to think that they could be drowned having Chriſt with them. <hi>Mark</hi> hath it, <hi>Careſt thou not that we periſh? Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>Maſter, Maſter, we periſh.</hi> It's true, danger ſtirs up fear, but to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much fear, having a good God and a gracious Chriſt, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:171178:319"/>weakneſs of faith: yet it's commendable in them that they go to Chriſt in their diſtreſs, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 56.3. <hi>What time I am affraid I will truſt in thee:</hi> Fervent prayer we ſee is wont to excite the Lord to help us in our diſtreſs. <hi>Jeſu Chriſte fer opem aut actum eſt de ſalute meâ,</hi> was a ſaying of <hi>Luther,</hi> which I have often uſed to the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt come and help me, or elſe I am undone for ever.</hi> This is according to the promiſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble and I will deliver thee, Pſalm</hi> 12.5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We periſh]</hi> They lay open their miſery before Chriſt. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 142.1, 2. <hi>I poured my complaint before him, I ſhewed before him my trouble, Iſai</hi> 26.17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12, 13. They cry not to the heathen <hi>Neptune,</hi> nor <hi>Aeolus,</hi> which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens thought gods of Windes and Seas, but to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.9. nor cry they to <hi>Nicholas, Mary, Barbara,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> to whom <hi>Papiſts</hi> think government of waters is committed. <hi>Chem. in loc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The grounds why in trouble we lay open our miſery to the Lord is, 1 Becauſe of our own helpleſneſs. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.3. Aſhur <hi>ſhall not ſave us, Pſalm</hi> 108.12. <hi>Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe of the fulneſs of ſalvation in God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 3.8. <hi>Salvation is of the Lord, Pſalm</hi> 44.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe of the inſufficiency of all outward helps in time of danger; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 142.4, 5. <hi>I looked on my right hand, and behold, refuge failed me, then cried I unto thee, O Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Gods peoples extremities are Gods opportunities for deliverance and ſalvation, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 102.18, 19. <hi>From Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth, to looſe thoſe that are appointed to death. Judges</hi> 20.26, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 26. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Why are ye fearfull, O ye of little faith? then he aroſe and rebuked the Windes and Seas, and there was a great Calm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a third circumſtance in the journey. Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:171178:320"/>them, <hi>Why are ye fearfull, O ye of little faith?</hi> Much fear argues little faith. Faith foreſees evils before they come, and oppoſes Chriſt againſt all. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. <hi>The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man foreſees the evil and hides himſelf,</hi> ſo that he is not affraid of evil tidings, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 112.7. Not as if Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns little faith, but reprehends it in them who had great means of a ſtrong faith, and had ſeen many of Chriſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and heard many of his Sermons. Little faith brings to Heaven, but not without doubts and fears.</p>
                  <p>Their faith was little, 1 In that they did not ſo fully believe his divine nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. Alſo, 2 In that they did not believe in his providence, as they ought, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences they had of him. 3 That they thought Chriſt being aſleep in his humane nature, could not help them in his divine nature. 4 In that they doubted of Chriſt his care of them, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.7. <hi>Caſting all your care on him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether is all fear contrary to faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; true filial fear is duty. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth always, Prov.</hi> 28.14. It ſprings from faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>By faith</hi> Noah <hi>was moved with fear;</hi> but perplexing and ſolicitous fear, when in times of danger we cannot reſt on God with quiet and confidence, which is ſo much more, becauſe God will keep him in perfect peace whoſe heart is ſtaid on him, <hi>Iſai</hi> 26.4, 5. This perplexing fear doth not declare we have no faith, but that we have a weak faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> Perſons may be Believers and yet be fearfull, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am affraid of thy judgments, Pſalm</hi> 55 4. <hi>My heart is ſore pained within me, and the terrours of death are fallen upon me, Heb.</hi> 12.21. <hi>Moſes</hi> exceedingly feared and quaked. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Without were fightings, within were fears.</hi> Theſe terrours are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Souldiers ſet in battel array, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. <hi>The arrows of the Almighty ſtick in me, the terrours of God do ſet themſelves in array againſt me.</hi> Yea Chriſt was not exempted from theſe ſears, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.33. He began to be ſore amazed, and to be very heavy.</p>
                  <pb n="629" facs="tcp:171178:320"/>
                  <p>There's a twofold fear, 1 Natural, with this was Chriſt affected. This was in <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 12.21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Sinfull, this is, 1 Perplexing. 2 Diſcouraging.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Perplexing. <hi>Job,</hi> 9.34. <hi>Let not his fear terrifie me.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Perplexed but not in deſpair. Eſai</hi> 7.2. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Judah</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi>'s coming againſt them, were moved as the trees of the Wood are moved with the winde. This is a ſore judgement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.65. <hi>The Lord ſhall give thee a trembling heart and ſorrow of minde, and thy life ſhall hang in doubt before thee, and thou ſhalt fear day and night: in the morning thou ſhalt ſay, would God it were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at even thou ſhalt ſay, would God it were morning,</hi> for the fear of thy heart wherewith thou ſhalt fear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Diſcouraging, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.13, 14. <hi>Lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;</hi> Now this diſcouraging fear is, when a ſoul looks upon the approaching evil above it's ſtrength, not looking on the ſtrength of God; as when a man meets with a Lion, or a ſubject conteſts with his Prince, both tremble in their ſpirits, becauſe the ſtrength of a man is not comparable to a Lion, nor the ſtrength of a ſubject to a Prince. Thus the Spies were diſcouraged look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſons of <hi>Anak,</hi> and comparing themſelves with them, <hi>Num.</hi> 13.28.</p>
                  <p>The miſchief of diſcouraging fear is this, that a man hath no heart to put forth his ſtrength in time of danger. The <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> being diſmaid with <hi>Goliath,</hi> durſt not make head againſt him, but fled before him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.11.24. hence when God gave <hi>Joſhua</hi> his command, he bade him not be afraid nor diſmayed, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Raiſe up your hearts, if not above perplexing fears, yet above diſcouraging. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.9. Chriſt bids the Diſciples when they ſhould hear of wars and commotions, <hi>not to be terrified.</hi> Theſe diſcouraging fears are a great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.36 <hi>Ile ſend a faintneſs into their hearts, and the ſound of a ſhaken leaf ſhall chaſe them.</hi> Theſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:171178:321"/>were affected with perplexing fear, and a little ſpice they had of diſcouraging fear.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>3</hi> Grounds againſt diſcouraging fear.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 The promiſe of Gods aſſiſtance in all troubles, <hi>Eſai</hi> 41.10. <hi>Fear not, for I am with thee, be not diſmayed for I am thy God. Heb.</hi> 13.6. We may boldly ſay, <hi>The Lord is our helper, and not fear what fleſh can do unto us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 From the reſpect God hath to the ſtrength of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>He will not ſuffer us to be tempted above that we are able, Jer.</hi> 46.28. Yea the cup, what ever it be, comes from a fathers hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe there's no troubles can make a Chriſtian truly miſerable, becauſe no troubles can ſever him from the love of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 38. We are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed, or ſtraitned, but that a door of deliverance is opened; we are perplexed, or void of counſel, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with fear, yet do we not deſpair, as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> did, caſt down, like a man by his adverſary, but not deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. becauſe God comes for our reſcue, perſecuted of men, but not forſaken of God.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the evil be impriſonment; how comfortable was <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in it? If burning and martyrdome, God will either abate the fire, or give thee ſtrength to bear it, as a Martyr once comforted himſelf and others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Be exhorted that you be not ſwallowed up of fears. This hath been the portion of the ungodly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.5. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhur</hi> had fear round about, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.4. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> in his fears goes from chamber to chamber to hide himſelf, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.24. The hearts of the men of <hi>Jericho</hi> melted for fear when the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came againſt them, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. ſo that there remained no more courage in any man. The men of <hi>Benjamin</hi> when they ſaw the City on fire on one ſide, that they could not retreat thereto, and the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> turning upon them, were amazed, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.40, 41.</p>
                  <p>We live in a time of fears and dangers. Sometimes <hi>mens
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:171178:321"/>hearts failing them for fear, looking on thoſe things that are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on the earth, Luk.</hi> 21.26. Sometimes <hi>our hearts trembling. becauſe of the Ark of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.13. as <hi>Eli</hi> his heart did; Sometimes fearing under the ſenſe of our unworthineſs. Now to quiet our hearts under all fears conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That all the evils men or devils can caſt upon us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach the ſoul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Get out the ſting of ſin by obtaining pardon. When this ſting is taken away the ſoul will be couragious, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57. <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi> then death will be like a ſerpent without a ſting. Without this the heart cannot be free from terror.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Look on grounds of encouragement; as thus, I have Chriſts righteouſneſs for mine, I have a diſpoſition to part with all for the Lord, I have comfortable anſwers in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I have a good conſcience in all things, I finde in my ſelf a thorow change, I endeavour in all things to eye God. Diſcouraging fears will not be caſt out without ſupporting reaſons. The ſoul being reaſonable muſt needs cloſe with reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fore-think of evils before they come, and ſet Chriſt againſt all. So <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11.26. In the worſt of times no enemy can take away Chriſt from me.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Get Gods fear. This will much eat out falſe fears, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. as the true Serpent ate up the falſe. See <hi>Eſai</hi> 8.12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Exerciſe confidence in the promiſes of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.3, 4. <hi>In God will I put my truſt, I will not fear what fleſh can do unto me. What time I am afraid I will put my truſt in thee, when thou goeſt through the fire, and through the water I will be with thee, Eſai</hi> 43.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Get God on your ſides. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.4. <hi>The Lord is on my ſide, I will not fear what man can do unto me.</hi> A Chriſtian ſhould be like a rock in the Sea, which though the waves break themſelves againſt it, yet it remaineth firm. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31.
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:171178:322"/>
                     <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us? viz.</hi> to hurt us, for elſe no man hath more enemies then a Chriſtian. This made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo couragious at <hi>Corinth, Acts</hi> 18.9, 10. <hi>Be not afraid, but ſpeak, for I am with thee, and no man ſhall ſet on thee to hurt thee.</hi> Yea this made <hi>Paul</hi> not to fear, when the Ship was every moment ready to be caſt away, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.23, 24. <hi>The Angel of God ſtood by me, whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve, ſaying, Fear not Paul.</hi> This made <hi>David</hi> not to fear though an Army of men were coming againſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1, 2, 3. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Motives to rid the heart of theſe fears.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 They procure great torment to the ſoul, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. Hence <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſetting forth the miſery of the people, ſaith, <hi>They ſhall eat their bread with quaking, and drink their water with carefulneſs, trembling and aſtoniſhment, Ezek.</hi> 12.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It's the end of our deliverance to ſerve God without theſe ſlaviſh fears, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.75. That we being delivered out of the hands of all our enemies might ſerve him without fear.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Theſe fears are ſometimes worſe then the evils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves feared, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.5, 6, 7. The <hi>Syrians</hi> in a vain fear ran away from the Camp, and left it to the plunder of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. Pſal.</hi> 53.5. <hi>There were they in great fear where no fear was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Many perſons have their ſlaviſh fears come upon them. <hi>Saul</hi> feared <hi>David</hi> would get the Kingdome, and he ſought all means baſely to prevent it, but could not, the Jews fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Romans</hi> would come and take away their place and Nation, if they let Chriſt alone, yet when they had ſlain him, the <hi>Romans</hi> came and took all from them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Theſe carnal fears are full of miſchief, as 1 To exalt creatures in the place of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They expoſe us to a ſnare, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. <hi>The fear of man brings a ſnare,</hi> ſo doth the fear of hell; many dare not do duty for fear they ſhould loſe their lives and go to hell.</p>
                  <pb n="633" facs="tcp:171178:322"/>
                  <p n="3">3 Theſe fears bereave us of the comfortable enjoyment of good things we have; fear of loſs of eſtate, liberty, life, takes away the comfort of it. That good hath the trueſt content therewith, for the loſs whereof we are habitually prepared, rather then loſe Chriſt and a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Though theſe fears may ſometimes put a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſelf-reformation, yet uſually this reformation that ariſes from theſe fears laſts no longer then the fear remains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.26. as we ſee in Mariners in a ſtorm. <hi>Job</hi> 41.25. <hi>When he raiſeth up himſelf, the mighty are afraid,</hi> and by reaſon of breakings they purifie themſelves.

He reproves the wind and ſea, as if a Maſter ſhould reprove a ſervant; here is a plain argument of Chriſts God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Who can command winde and ſea ſave God alone? As his power was ſeen in quieting the ſtorms of the ſea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the ſame power can quiet the ſtorms in the Churches, and among good men, and the ſtorms that Satans temptations ſhall ſtir up in the hearts of Saints. So when there are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate ſtorms in our hearts, the command of Chriſt ſhould make a calm. It's a comfortable thing in a ſtorm to be in covenant with him whom windes and ſeas obey. Chriſt ſpeaks alike to windes and ſtorms, diſeaſes and devils, he quiets them with the word of his mouth, and ſo can he quiet ſtorms in the Commonwealth, <hi>Pſal</hi> 65.7. <hi>Which ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the noiſe of the ſeas, the noiſe of their waves, and the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of the people.</hi> Onely in theſe times of confuſions let us awake the Lord by our prayers, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.3, 4.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And there was a great calm]</hi> See the obedience of the mightieſt creatures to God; how will this condemn our diſobedience? See how windes yield obedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.26: compared with 29. See the ſeas obedience, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22. Let not the winde and ſea overcome you in overcoming the ſtorms of the minde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 27. <hi>But the men marvelled, ſaying, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and ſea obey him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's a fifth circumſtance, they reaſon thus. He whom winds and ſeas obey muſt be greater then all mortalls, but they obey this man, therefore he is greater then all men. This ſhould ſtir us up to confidence in the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe alſo in me; q. d.</hi> I am God as well as my Father, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on me. So that as it is ſaid of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.9. <hi>Thou ruleſt the raging of the ſea; when the waves thereof ariſe thou ſtilleſt them;</hi> ſo alſo doth Chriſt at this time. The creatures are Gods executioners to puniſh man for ſin; when they exceed herein, the Lord reproves them, as a father doth a ſchoolmaſter when he ſees him unmeaſurably to chaſtiſe his ſon. The greatneſs of which miracle, which made it more admirable, was, that whereas uſually in ſtorms, when the wind ceaſes the ſea is not calm till a good while after, but here both wind ceaſes and the ſea is calm together, in an inſtant, ſhowing it came from a miracle, not from nature. For the calm was called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>All expoſitors make the Church an arbitrary Antitype of this toſſed ſhip; as this ſhip was poor, a mean fiſher boat, not to be compared to the great Merchant ſhips and men of war, ſo the poor Church is not to be compared, for outward glory, with the kingdoms of the world. And as when the proud Scribe leaves Chriſt, the poor diſciples ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Chriſt through the ſea; ſo, when rich and great
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:171178:323"/>men leave Chriſt, the poor diſciples accompany Chriſt through the troubleſome ſea of this world. Again as this ſhip was in danger, ſo hath the Church been oft; in <hi>Egypt, Babylon,</hi> in the ten perſecutions, and Popiſh Tyranny, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be ſwallowed up of waves, but the Lord ſeaſonably appears, either by cutting off Tyrants, as he did <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 14.25. and <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12.23. Or by putting a hook in their noſtrils, as he did to <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.28. or by turning the hearts of perſecutors, whereby the Churches have reſt, as he did <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9.31.</p>
                  <p>This Church ſo toſſed is not the Roman Church, as the Papiſts paint the Pope to be the ſteers-man ſitting at the helm, and the Cardinals, Biſhops and Prieſts to be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, but its a company of Saints, who becauſe <hi>they will live godly, ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. With theſe it is that Chriſt is preſent in the ſignes of the covenant, and in the word of promiſe, and with his ſupporting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in time of ſtorms: they pretend they have no ſchiſmes nor contentions, but perfect unity; but this proves them not to be the true Church, becauſe the ſhip wherein Chriſt was, was expoſed to ſtorms, and Chriſt came not <hi>to bring peace, but a ſword,</hi> Matth. 10.34.</p>
                  <p>And if unity among them might prove them a Church, then might it prove the Turks and Jews to be Churches, who have more of unity then they.</p>

                  <p>Here is Chriſt his permiſſion to the Devils to go into the Swine, which was, 1 That all men might ſee how miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous the Devils would be, ſhould the Lord permit them, they would deſtroy all mankinde in one hour, yea all living creatures, ſhould God take away his reſtraint from them; ſo that as the ſafety of Sheep is not in the clemency of the Wolf, but in the Shepherds eye, ſo our ſafety is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Lord who bindes up Satan.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 For the further publication of the Miracle, had the Devils onely been caſt out and no more, the Miracle might have been but little taken notice of, but the Devils going into the Hogs all men muſt needs note it, and the whole countrey have information herein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That theſe two poſſeſſed perſons who were freed from
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:171178:327"/>theſe Devils might ſee the greatneſs of the mercy, to be freed from ſo many Devils as a whole Legion, and ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and bloudy who will deſtroy all they can deſtroy; and alſo what they might have expected from the Devils if God had not kept them, when they ſee the Hogs run headlong into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And behold, the whole Herd ran violently down a ſteep place into the Sea, and periſhed in the Waters] viz.</hi> Into the Lake of <hi>Genezareth,</hi> which for the breadth and length is called a Sea, which, according to <hi>Joſephus,</hi> was fifty furlongs broad and an hundred furlongs long. We may ſee what Satans bloudy rage is, we ſee what his cruelty was, who when he had commiſſion given to puniſh <hi>Job,</hi> deſtroyed his children, and did what miſchief otherwiſe which he was permitted to do, <hi>Job</hi> 1.13, 14. to <hi>v.</hi> 20. Satan made no delay, <hi>Job</hi> 2.6, 7. As ſoon as <hi>Job</hi> was in Satans hand he ſmote him with Boils.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 33. <hi>And they that kept them fled and went their ways into the City, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the poſſeſſed of the Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's like they went to excuſe themſelves that the loſs of the Hogs came not through any careleſneſs in them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they tell of the good that Chriſt had done, as well as of the loſſes which befell. The bleſſings that come by the Goſpel, as well as the loſſes are to be publiſhed; many poring too much upon what they may loſe by Chriſt, and not conſidering what they may gain by him, are apt to fly off from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 34. <hi>And behold, the whole City came out to meet</hi> Jeſus, <hi>and when they ſaw him they beſought him that he would depart out of their Coaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gadarens,</hi> having heard the report, they go to ſee the men out of whom the Devils were caſt, and they ſaw them cloathed and in their right minde, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.15. <hi>Luke</hi> ſets down that he ſate at <hi>Jeſus</hi> feet, which the Scripture
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:171178:327"/>ſets down to be the poſture of a Diſciple. <hi>Paul</hi> brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel, Acts</hi> 22.3. and <hi>Mary</hi> at the feet of <hi>Chriſt, Luke</hi> 10.39. For Teachers were wont to ſit in a Chair, or in a more high place, and the Hearers ſtood round about at their feet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. This man fitting thus proves himſelf to have a ſound minde.</p>
                  <p>The effect this Miracle wrought on theſe <hi>Gadarens</hi> was, that they were taken with great fear, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.35, 37.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe they ſaw the dead carkaſſes of their Hogs ſwimming up and down, probably before the Swineherds could bring them news.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Leſt Chriſt ſhould puniſh them for their murmuring againſt him, and ſhould permit the Devils that were gone into the Hogs to come out of the Hogs into themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they beſought him that he would depart out of their Coaſts]</hi> They ſhould have given thanks to God, for theſe two men delivered from the Devils, and that not onely they, but all the Countrey were ſo well rid of ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Devils, but partly out of Diſtruſt and ſlaviſh fear, leſt the preſence of Chriſt might do more miſchief unto them (thinking that to be done by Chriſt which was onely permitted by Chriſt, but done by the Devils) and partly becauſe they ſaw Chriſt was a <hi>Jew</hi> and an holy man, and themſelves wicked <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they feared leſt Chriſt for their wickedneſſes, and alſo for difference of Religion, would puniſh them more ſorely than yet he had done, that as their Hogs were deſtroyed, ſo in a ſhort time their Sheep, Cows, and Oxen, and Children might be deſtroyed, hence they beſeech him <hi>to depart out of their Coaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the perſons who beſought him to depart, were not onely all the Citizens of <hi>Gedara,</hi> but the whole multitude of the countrey round about, <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi> no man deſiring the preſence of Chriſt. A fearfull ſign of Chriſt leaving a People; when all conſent to his departure, then Chriſt had no Meſſage to declare.</p>
                  <pb n="644" facs="tcp:171178:328"/>
                  <p>Here were two great ſins more. 1 Univerſal Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when Chriſt came through a dangerous Storm for their good to caſt out Devils, to make the ways ſafe for Paſſengers, when before none durſt go that way, and would have tendered means of grace had they not reſiſted, yet they unworthily reject all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Horrible covetouſneſs, preferring Hogs before Chriſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. There are many <hi>Gergeſenes,</hi> who, when they know better, for gain-ſake do worſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Contempt of means of grace, how wofull will their condition be in the day of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>In Chriſt are two graces conſiderable, 1 That he doth not render evil for evil, but good for evil, ſending back one of theſe healed men to preach to the <hi>Capernaites:</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.38, 39. He bids him preach how great things God had done for him, which he did not onely there, but through <hi>Decapolis, Mark</hi> 5.20. he preached the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That he peaceably departs from them back again, and goes into <hi>Galilee, Matth.</hi> 9.1. The Goſpel needs not be forced but when refuſed; Preachers have a call to depart, it being refuſed univerſally, as here it was, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.34. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46.</p>
                  <p>In the man healed obſerve three things, 1 That he ſat at Chriſts feet as a Diſciple. 2 That leaving his own countrey he was willing to go with Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.38. 3 His obedience, when Chriſt ſent him back again to his own countrey and kindred he was willing to go, trying whether that effect of Doctrine which could not be by Chriſt, might by him, being one of their own countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come effectual: withall in ſending him thus, Chriſt ſhews that an active life is to be preferred before a contemplative, firſt the body muſt be exerciſed in labour, and then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed by contemplation.</p>

               <p>WE have in this ſtory, 1 The return of Chriſt from the countrey of the <hi>Gergeſenes</hi> into his own City, <hi>Capernaum,</hi> whence lately he came, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2 His miraculous power, in not onely healing a man ſick of the Palſey, but alſo forgiving his ſins, <hi>v.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The cavil of the Scribes againſt him, charging him with blaſphemy for his forgiving the Palſey-man, <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Chriſt his vindication of himſelf, together with his aſſerting his power to forgive ſins, 1 By his knowing their thoughts, <hi>Why think ye evil in your hearts? v.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Becauſe he was able to do the thing which was more hard, therefore he was able to do that which was more eaſie, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Whether is it eaſier to ſay, Thy ſins be forgiven thee? or to ſay, Ariſe and walk? q. d.</hi> You think it harder to heal a Palſey man, than to forgive ſins; now you have ſeen me do that which you think harder, therefore can I without blaſphemy do that which is eaſier.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The effect this Miracle had among the Multitude, they 1 Marvelled, 2 Glorified God, who had given ſuch power to men, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He came into his own City]</hi> That is, of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> called his own, becauſe uſually he dwelt there, and preached more Sermons and did more Miracles there, than elſewhere. That <hi>Capernaum</hi> is meant here, appears <hi>Mark</hi> 2.1. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>cap.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Leaving</hi> Nazareth, <hi>he came and dwelt in</hi> Capernaum.</p>
               <pb n="646" facs="tcp:171178:329"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>They brought him a man ſick of the Palſey lying on a bed]</hi> A palſey is the diſſolution of the ſinews of the body, which are the inſtruments of motion, without which a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move or walk. Hence this Palſey man was born of four, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.3. For charity requires that the well and healthy ſuccour the ſick. <hi>Luke</hi> ſets down there was ſo great a multitude came to the houſe where Chriſt was, that no man could come in. Hence thoſe that bore the Palſey-man uncovered the roof, and let down the Palſey-man to Chriſt, though doubtleſs the rubbiſh did fall down, yet was not Chriſt offended. Herewith learn we to take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to come to Chriſt, and to bring others to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus ſeeing their faith, ſaith to the ſick of the Palſey, Son, be of good cheer, thy ſins be forgiven thee]</hi> Chriſt ſeeing both the faith of the Palſey-man, and of thoſe that brought him, ſpeaks thus, not as if another mans faith can profit to the forgiveneſs of our ſins, but hereby Chriſt applies par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the Palſey-man, and to ſo many as believed, who helped to bring him to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy ſins be forgiven thee]</hi> Nothing will cheer the ſoul unleſs forgiveneſs of ſins go along with it, not to have a diſeaſe removed. Chriſt is not onely the Phyſician of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, but of ſins; firſt he forgives the ſins, and then heals the Palſey, to ſhow that ſin is the root and fountain of diſeaſes. Whereas the conſcience of former evils might perplex the Palſey-man, that he ſhould not obtain healing, Chriſt tells him that ſin, the cauſe of ſickneſs, was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and therefore he might comfortably expect heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This was not faith of miracles, which is a confidence of a future miracle, but faith of juſtification, which if the Palſey-man had not before, by Chriſt his ſpeaking it was wrought in him, but it ſeems he had it before, in that Chriſt calls him Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did Chriſt firſt forgive his ſins before heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him?</p>
               <pb n="647" facs="tcp:171178:329"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Becauſe ſin was the cauſe of ſickneſs, and to remove the effect, there muſt be firſt a removing of the cauſe. Palſey and other diſeaſes ariſe rather from ſin, then from natural cauſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That forſeeing the calumny of the Phariſees againſt Chriſt his miracle, Chriſt might prove his Godhead firſt by this, that he knew the thoughts, ſecondly by this, that he had power on earth to forgive ſins.</p>
               <p>We may ſee Chriſts bounty, that he heals the whole man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.23. Learn we from our afflictions to reflect upon our ſins as the cauſe of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 3. <hi>And behold, certain of the Scribes ſaid within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, This man blaſphemeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here's the calumny of the Scribes and Phariſees againſt Chriſt, which was this: he that is not God but takes upon him power to forgive ſins, he blaſphemes; but Jeſus the Son of man is not God, and yet takes upon him power to forgive ſins, therefore he blaſphemes.</p>
               <p>The propoſition was moſt true, 1 Becauſe none can forgive offences againſt God, but againſt whom they are committed. 2 Becauſe to forgive ſins in God, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forgive the guilt but the puniſhment and curſe; but the Phariſees err'd in the aſſumption. Hence Chriſtproved himſelf by two reaſons that he was God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Within themſelves]</hi> Not among themſelves as if they had been murmuring one among another of Chriſts do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; hence <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith not, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Jeſus knowing their words, but ſaith, <hi>Jeſus knowing their thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that they ſaid within themſelves was, as <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, <hi>cap.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Who can forgive ſins but God alone?</hi> Iſa. 43.25. <hi>I am he that blot out thine iniquities.</hi> Mic. 6.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, forgiving iniquity, tranſgresſion and ſin.</hi> Jer. 31.34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their ſins no more.</hi> Its like the Scribes remembring theſe and ſuch like places, and not conſidering what was ſpoken out
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:171178:330"/>of the Old Teſtament concerning the <hi>Mesſiah,</hi> conceived theſe murmurings in their hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This man blaſphemeth]</hi> Omitting the acceptions of this word, as elſe where it is taken, here it ſignifies to arrogate that which belongs unto God unto a mans ſelf. The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers or Scribes thought this power (mentioned, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath put away thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>) was incommunicable; now Chriſt, in token that he had this power, 1 Works a miracle. 2 Searches their hearts, which is onely peculiar to God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.39. <hi>Thou onely knows the hearts of the children of men,</hi> Jer. 17.10, 11. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.7. <hi>The Lord looks upon the heart.</hi> Rom. 8.27.</p>
               <p>Yet was the arguing of theſe Scribes of no weight to reaſon thus; God never gave the power of forgiveneſs of ſins to any man hitherto, therefore he cannot grant it; none of the Prophets could do it, therefore the <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhall not be able to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 4. <hi>And Jeſus knowing their thoughts ſaid, Why think ye evil in your hearts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus knowing their thoughts]</hi> Here was one note of his God-head, to know the thoughts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>What man knows the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him?</hi> He muſt needs be God which did this, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24, 25. <hi>Jeſus did not commit himſelf to them, becauſe he knew all men, and needed not that any ſhould teſtifie of man, for he knew what was in man.</hi> He did not know their hearts by outward geſtures, as by whiſpering, laughing, but he knew their hearts without ſignes, when they ſat quiet and ſtill, nor did he know them by the revelation of another, as the Prophets did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.3, 4. as the Prophet <hi>Ahiah</hi> did the wife of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> but by his own power, as being the ſearcher of hearts, which God onely is.</p>
               <p>And needs muſt he know the thoughts, becauſe he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.10, 11. beſides elſe how ſhould he
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:171178:330"/>make manifeſt the counſels and ſecrets of the heart? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why think ye evil in your hearts]</hi> That is falſe, malitious and blaſphemous things, as if I were onely a man, when I am God. Theſe thoughts were evil, 1 coming from the devil and their wicked hearts, 2 In reſpect of matter, as being derogatory to the majeſty of Chriſt. From this two obſervations.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The thoughts of men are known to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The conſideration of this, that our thoughts are known to Chriſt, ſhould be a check unto us from thinking evil in our hearts.</p>

When the Diſciples were thinking which of them ſhould be greateſt, Jeſus perceiving the thought of their heart took a little childe and ſet him before them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24, 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe he hath diſcovered to men their thoughts, as here to theſe Scribes, and to <hi>Judas</hi> before he acted any treaſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.32. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.38. when the Diſciples were affrighted Chriſt ſays, <hi>Why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts?</hi> The woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> John 4.29. <hi>He told me all that ever I did.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 Beware, 1 Of vain thoughts, which is, 1 For mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we ſhall think on fooliſh things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.9. <hi>The thought of fooliſhneſs is ſin.</hi>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But we cannot hinder wicked and vain thoughts from ariſing in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We cannot hinder them from being, but we may hinder them from lodging in us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. We cannot hinder perſons from coming to our houſe, but we can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:171178:331"/>them from lodging in our houſe; we cannot hinder a Bird from flying over our heads, but we may keep it from making a neſt in our hair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whence come theſe wicked thoughts in the heart?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 From Satan, who inſpires and injects evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe ſometimes are diſcerned by the ſuddenneſs, coming like a flaſh of Lightning; by their violence. It's a ſad thing to have the devil Lord of our imagination, as in <hi>Judas, John</hi> 13.12. By their ſtrangeneſs, being thrown in, as <hi>Joſephs</hi> cup in <hi>Benjamins</hi> ſack. By their unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tending to deſtroy, ſo to Chriſt, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Satan ſuggeſted to <hi>David</hi> to number the people, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. Some think it more ſad for the devil to run away with our thoughts then eſtates.</p>
               <p n="2">2 From corruption, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Out of the Heart proceed evil thoughts, Jam.</hi> 1.14, 15. Now whether they come from Satan or corruption they ſhall not be imputed to us, if we diſallow them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> I diſallow them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If thou doeſt, they will be burdens to thee, and thou wilt complain to God in prayer againſt them, and ſtrive to turn thy imagination from them to God, that the thoughts of God may be the poſſeſſions of thy heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Try what thy thoughts are, whether they be good or bad. Trials. 1 When they come from a good principle within. <hi>A good man hath a good treaſure in his heart,</hi> Matth. 12.35. <hi>and from thence he brings forth good things,</hi> hence his purpoſes are onely good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.23.12.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When good thoughts are not onely caſt into the ſoul, but we ſtudy them. Many think, becauſe they have ſome thoughts of death, judgement, heaven and hell, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, God and Chriſt, therefore their hearts are good, but theſe thoughts are onely the hauntings of the ſpirit, to leave them more inexcuſable. Contrarily godly men ſtrive to ſtudy good thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59.</p>
               <pb n="652" facs="tcp:171178:332"/>
               <p n="3">3 Whether are the good thoughts thou haſt tranſient, or permanent and abiding? <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>The Lord ſaw all the thoughts of mens hearts were vain.</hi>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> They had ſome good thoughts, how could this be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were vain for want of duration.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Whether are thy thoughts brought forth into act? Godly men act the good they think of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I thought upon my wayes,</hi> what then followed? <hi>I turned my feet into thy teſtimonies. Luke</hi> 15.18. The Prodigal thought of his miſery, what followed? <hi>I will ariſe, and will go to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. Wicked men think of leaving their formality, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, but are never better; they think of hell but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not it will be their portion.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It's no good pulſe of ſoul when the heart is preſently tired with good thoughts, but never weary with worldly thoughts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5.</p>

                  <head>Motives to look to the thoughts.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 Thoughts are the declaratives of the ſoul, as the Sun, Fire, Honey, Gold, ſhew by their effects what they are, ſo doth the heart ſhew what it is by the thoughts. When the thoughts are worldly, proud and revengefull, it argues the heart is ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They that are after the fleſh minde the things of the fleſh.</hi> The thoughts are the immediate acts of the heart, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.21. <hi>From within, out of the heart of man, proceed evil thoughts.</hi> We do not judg of a Fountain by the Waters that run from it many Miles off, but by the Water that flows immediately therefrom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Thoughts are the ſouls ſervants, as the Centurion ſaid to his Servant, <hi>Go, and he goeth, Matth.</hi> 8.8. So bid your thoughts think upon grace, or ſin, they will do it. Send them a hundred Mile off they will go, ſend them into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they will go, and talk with God and Chriſt by faith, and with your ſelves by reflexion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thoughts are the ſymptomes of the ſoul. As we know the ſtate of the body by the ſymptomes, ſo may we
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:171178:333"/>know the ſoul, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt ſeek things above, ſet your affections on things above. Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They that are after the fleſh do ſavour the things of the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 The thoughts are the acts of the ſoul. 1 They are the freeſt acts; a man ſometimes ſpeaks not as he would, works not as he would, but he always thinks as he will; now if you would judg of a man, judg of him by what he doth freely, and not by compulſion. <hi>Peter</hi> though he denied Chriſt, he denied him not in heart, therefore the heart ſhews what it is by the thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Thoughts are the continued acts of the ſoul. We are not always praying and reading, but we are always think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, thy God thou art always thinking on.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The univocal acts of the heart. The univocal act of light is to enlighten, the univocal act of a dead carrion is ſtink, ſo the univocal act of the heart are thoughts; if they be proud and unclean, ſo is the heart.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Thoughts are Gods tribute, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart.</hi> If thy neighbour come for fire thou canſt not give it him, if thou takeſt away the heart thereof; ſo thou canſt not give God thy heart and withhold thy thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Thoughts are a mans companions. A man will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full what companions he hath; you never go out nor in, but your companions go along with you, nay they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company you to another World.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The Law of Retaliation calls for our thoughts to be for God, becauſe he hath ſo many thoughts toward us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40.5. <hi>Thy thoughts which are to us ward they cannot be reckoned up, they are more than can be numbered. Pſalm</hi> 139.17. <hi>How precious are thy thoughts, O God, unto me!

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Terrour to all wicked men who allow wicked thoughts in them. God knows how thou ſmothers thine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and goeſt againſt it, what thoughts of denying Chriſt and temporizing are in thee, what tricks thou haſt to keep off conviction, what heartleſneſs in duty, what rovings in prayer. Thou wouldſt be aſhamed if a man ſaw the wickedneſs of thy thoughts, how much more when God beholds them?

                  <p>And doth he not then know thy preſent wicked thoughts? <hi>Pſalm</hi> 50.21. <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was ſuch an one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee,</hi> or catalogize them, (as I take it ſome renders the
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:171178:334"/>word) <hi>He ſees God is not in all thy thoughts, Pſal.</hi> 10.4. Yea he knows thy unclean and revengefull thoughts, which are abomination to him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15, 26. <hi>And though thou diggeſt deep to hide thy counſell from the Lord, yet ſhalt not thou be able, Iſai</hi> 29.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>And whether is eaſier to ſay, Thy ſins be forgiven thee, or to ſay, Ariſe and walk?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt brings a ſecond argument to prove he had power to forgive ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe he was able to do that, which in the opinion of the Phariſees was more hard, therefore he had power to do that which was more eaſie. It was more to forgive ſin then to heal a diſeaſe, but becauſe the healing of a diſeaſe was viſible, and the forgiveneſs of ſins was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, therefore healing the Palſey-man ſeemed to the Phariſees to be the more difficult work: yet is forgiveneſs of ſin the harder work, 1 Becauſe no diſeaſe is contrary to the nature of God, but ſin is. 2 Healing a Palſey is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural work, but forgiveneſs of ſins is a ſupernatural work.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt applies his ſpeech to their capacity, who, being meer natural men, were moved with outward ſignes more then with the ſpiritual power of Chriſt. So Chriſt reaſons, <hi>John</hi> 5.28. Chriſt proves the effectual power of his voice to quicken dead ſouls, becauſe the ſame voice of Chriſt ſhall at the day of reſurrection be able to quicken dead bodies. Beſides this miraculous healing was a ſigne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the other, that he had power to forgive ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>But, that yee may know the ſon of man hath power on earth to forgive ſins, then ſaith he to the ſick of the Palſey, Ariſe, take up thy Bed and walk.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt here poſitively proves that he had power on earth to forgive ſins, becauſe miraculouſly by a word of his mouth he cauſes the Palſey man to walk, ſo that he aroſe and departed to his houſe immediately.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Power on earth to forgive ſins]</hi> That is authoritatively.
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:171178:335"/>Preachers forgive onely declaratively, as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy iniquity, John</hi> 20.23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſaith he to the ſick of the Palſey, Ariſe, take up thy Bed and walk]</hi> That ſo this cure Chriſt wrought might appear to be a perfect cure, Chriſt bids the Palſey man, 1 Ariſe. 2 Take up his Bed and carry it on his ſhoulders. 3 Walk.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>But when the multitude ſaw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given ſuch power unto men.</hi>

                     <hi>Multitude ſaw it they marvelled]</hi> Here's the effect of this miracle, all (ſaving the Phariſees, who had accuſed Chriſt of blaſphemy) wondered at the miracle, and ſo broke forth in praiſing God. They wondered at it having never ſeen any ſuch example of ſuch a thing in former times. The tendency of their wonder and praiſes was, that perſons with more confidence ſhould ſubmit themſelves to the doctrine of Chriſt, whiles they believed he was able to pardon their ſins.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sitting at the receipt of cuſtom]</hi> That is at the Table of the Publicans, where <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s tribute was brought and paid. <hi>Matthew</hi> names his condition of life, that he may confeſs to all what a great ſinner he had been, and alſo acknowledge Gods grace in calling him home, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17.

                  <p>Now, when Chriſt bade <hi>Matthew</hi> follow him, it's like he uſed more words to him, and gave him reaſons, which, together with the miracles he ſaw from Chriſt, prevailed upon him; for it's not enough onely to call a perſon to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt, but we muſt endeavour to convince him by reaſon that he may follow Chriſt, as that elſe we cannot be Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.24. elſe we do not <hi>abide in Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6.</p>

                  <p>We ſee <hi>Matthew</hi> out of gratitude to Chriſt carries him from the cuſtome houſe to his own houſe, and makes him a feaſt, where he invites the Diſciples of Chriſt, and the publicans, who its like had heard him preach at the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome-houſe, where we are taught not onely thankfulneſs to our benefactors, but may fee the lawful uſe of feaſting, practiſed both by <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and others; even Chriſt was preſent at ſuch a feaſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.1. to <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.</p>

Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were diſſolute Jews, who ſlighting the Jewiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were converſant among the Gentiles, and would eat and drink with them.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>And when the Phariſees ſaw it, they ſaid unto his Diſciples, Why eateth your maſter with Publicans and ſinners?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before the Phariſees were offended at the miracles of Chriſt, now they are offended at his life, why he did eat with Publicans and ſinners. There is no remedy againſt the biting of a Sycophant, as the Proverb is, they cavil at a good action. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in token of thankfulneſs to Chriſt for the benefit of regeneration and being to leave his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer profeſſion, that he might give an account to his fellow Publicans thereof, that either they might by his example leave their employments, or elſe might deal juſtly and mercifully therein, makes a feaſt for Chriſt and theſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon theſe Phariſees propound this queſtion, not for ſatisfaction, but detraction, that they might calumniate Chriſt: they ſeem to reaſon thus, No Godly man can eat with Publicans and ſinners, but Chriſt eateth with Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and ſinners, therefore he is no Godly man.

<pb n="662" facs="tcp:171178:337"/>according to the Phariſees teaching, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the doctrine of Chriſt is true, but its falſe according to the doctrine of Chriſt, for ſinners are to be ſhunn'd where there is danger to be infected by them, they are not to be ſhunn'd when there is likelihood we may gain them by our example and admonitions. Beſides <hi>Matthew</hi> might think Chriſt would utter Godly ſpeeches at this feaſt to work on his fellow Publicans. Nothing is more troubleſome and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd then a dumb feaſt, for ſpeeches are the true ſawces of meat; one word is ſharpned by another, and not onely is the belly fed with meats, but the mind with doctrine.

                  <p>We have here Chriſts ſecond anſwer to the proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Phariſees concerning the queſtion put by the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees to Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>viz. Why eateth your maſter with Publicans.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus heard that]</hi> That is, by the relation of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for the Phariſees durſt not object it to Chriſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Chriſt therefore hearing of it, both defends the deed, and diſcovers their ignorance: he defends it, 1 From the rule of correlation, ſick perſons and a Phyſician are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be together. Sick perſons are the proper object of a Phyſician, and the end of Medicinal Phyſick is the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſick perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They that be whole need not a Phyſician but they that are ſick]</hi> The words are a Proverb, <hi>q.d.</hi> It's no diſgrace for a
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:171178:342"/>Phyſician to be with ſick perſons for to cure them, no more is it for me to be with ſinners for their cure.</p>
                  <p>But for you Phariſees, you are whole in your own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, you were never wounded in the ſight of your ſins, but, being full of your own ſelf-righteouſneſs, think you need not me for your Phyſician, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11.</p>
                  <p>Not as if the Phariſees were whole indeed, but Chriſt ſpeaks to them by way of ſuppoſition, <hi>q.d.</hi> If you be ſuch as you would ſeem to be, you need not my help, but indeed you are not ſuch, but they that indeed are wounded for their ſins, to them I am precious, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 38, 41. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18.</p>
                  <p>As they that are ſick cannot help themſelves, no more can ſick ſouls help themſelves without me; now if you ask what that Diacatholicon or univerſal Medicine is, it is the atonement of Chriſt upon the Croſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12.10.22. applyed by the Spirit and faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, 11. For as other medicines are not effectual, till they be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and received, no more is this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him</hi> (meaning into their hearts) <hi>to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, Act.</hi> 4.12. He is the true <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> who took care of the wounded man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.33. He is not like a covetous Phyſician who will not go to any but to thoſe that can pay him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 But he is a free Phyſician who calls all to come to him, without money, and without price, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 He is a ſympathizing Phyſician, and therefore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt to do us good. He is <hi>touched with the feeling of our wants, Heb.</hi> 4.15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 He is an able Phyſician. How great ſoever the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was, if it were curable, he could cure it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18. <hi>In that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them that are tempted.</hi> There's much talking of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacea,</hi> or Univerſal Medicine, but he hath it indeed. Some Phyſicians are onely expert for ſome one diſeaſe, but Chriſt is for every diſeaſe.</p>
                  <pb n="674" facs="tcp:171178:343"/>
                  <p>Now for thee who art a patient to Chriſt, 1 Thou muſt come to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. So let thy diſeaſe be what it will, he will not caſt thee off. <hi>He ſaves to the uttermoſt them that come to God by him. Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Thou muſt acknowledge thy diſeaſe to him, as the patient doth to the Phyſician, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive them.</hi> Not but that Chriſt knows them well enough, but he will have thee to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible whence thy healing comes. As in the blind man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.33. who begging mercy of Chriſt in general, had it not; but being ſenſible of his blindneſs and deſiring ſight, Chriſt gave it him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 As it is a good help to the Patient to have a good ſubordinate confidence in the Phyſician; ſo it's requiſite if thou come to Chriſt to place all thy confidence in thy Phyſician, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. as knowing ſalvation is not in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice, for I am not come to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt brings a ſecond argument from the Scripture to juſtifie his eating and converſing with ſinners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Go ye and learn what that meaneth]</hi> Chriſt upbraids their ignorance, and ſends theſe doctors to ſchool. So did he <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.3.5.19.4.21.16.22.31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice]</hi> That is, 1 not outward ceremonies without inward obedience. 2 Not ſacrifice in compariſon of mercy; mercy ought to overweigh ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſacrifice muſt give place to mercy. Among men, when two laws are made which interfere, that which tends moſt to righteouſneſs, profit and honeſty ought to take place. So that Chriſt ſhews, that all the commands of ſhunning familiarity with wicked men, muſt be ſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that occaſions and opportunities of bringing them into the way of holineſs muſt not be neglected. And
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:171178:343"/>therefore when that Chriſt endeavoured to bring back theſe Publicans, who were as ſo many fugitives from God, he was not to be blamed herein. So that place, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Count him not as an enemy, but admoniſh him as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> Leſt any man ſhould think that when a man was caſt out, all coming to him was forbid, the Apoſtle adds, <hi>they are not to be counted enemies</hi> (as the <hi>Jews</hi> counted ſuch) but they are to be brotherly admoniſhed. When the bond of Church Communion, or Chriſtian Communion, is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet there remains a bond of humane nature, and the remembrance of former friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>So that Chriſt by his example and doctrine propoſes to the Phariſees to follow mercy; as if he ſhould ſay, I had rather have mercy on poor ſinners, then offer many ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices with you, and this my practiſe you may ſee juſtified, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6.</p>

                     <hi>For I am not come to call the righteous but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance]</hi> Here's a third Reaſon whereby Chriſt defends his action of converſing with ſinners, to wit, his Office of Mediatour; <hi>I came not to call the righteous but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> By Righteous he means Phariſaical ſelf-juſticia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who are drunk with the opinion of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; by ſinners are not meant onely excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſons, and ſuch as live a looſe and diſſolute life, but alſo all men out of Chriſt. Again, Chriſt taxes them that they made no diſtinction betwixt penitent and impenitent ſinners. It was always lawfull to keep company with peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners, though not with impenitent.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, perſons called by Chriſt are called to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Let no man, upon pretence of his intereſt in Chriſt, live in a ſtate of looſneſs. <hi>The grace of God that brings ſalvation, teaches us to deny ungodlineſs, Titus</hi> 2.12.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 14. <hi>Then came to him the Diſciples of</hi> John, <hi>ſaying, Why do we and the Phariſees faſte oft, but thy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples faſte not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are two things conſiderable, 1 A Queſtion mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Scribes and Phariſees, as the authours, and <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples, as the actours, which was, why they faſted oft but the Diſciples of Chriſt faſted not?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Chriſts Anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Can the Children of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber faſte, &amp;c.</hi> which he backs from three Reaſons;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That they had no cauſe at preſent of faſting, but of rejoycing, he the Bridegroom being with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That though at preſent they did not faſte and mourn, yet in a ſhort time they ſhould have cauſe ſo to do.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Diſciples being young Converts, the duty of faſting was not ſo ſutable, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and that the Goſpel-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was not ſo ſutable to them, in regard of their old car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal natures and legal cuſtomes, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then came to him the Diſciples of</hi> John, <hi>ſaying, Why do
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:171178:344"/>we, &amp;c.] Mark</hi> ſaith, The Diſciples of the Phariſees toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, propound this Queſtion, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.18. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees asked him, Luke</hi> 5.33. The reconciliation is eaſie; the Phariſees by their Diſciples ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> to ask this Queſtion, ſo that both askt the Queſtion, the Phariſees as the authours, their Diſciples and <hi>Johns</hi> as the actours: the Phariſees were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to encounter Chriſt themſelves, hence they uſe Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; the Devil hath a notable art in ſowing conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why do we and the Phariſees faſte oft, but thy Diſciples faſte not]</hi> The occaſion of this Queſtion was ſome Faſte-day which the Phariſees appointed and kept, wherein Chriſts Diſciples did eat and drink, by which is not meant a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faſte, which was to be kept by all the members of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and ſo conſequently by Chriſt, ſeeing he acknowledges himſelf a member thereof, <hi>John</hi> 4.22. All the <hi>Jews</hi> upon pain of cutting off were to obſerve the tenth day of the ſeventh moneth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.29, 30, 31.23.27. this was their onely preſcribed Faſte: but it was ſome private Faſte to gain glory and praiſe to the Phariſees, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. <hi>The Phariſee faſted twice a week.</hi> But <hi>Johns</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples kept it out of ſome other end, but Chriſts Diſciples did uſe to eat and drink as at other times.</p>
                  <p>Beſides it's like <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples might propound this Queſtion out of zeal to their Maſter, and out of envy to Chriſt, as in another caſe, <hi>John</hi> 3.26.</p>
                  <p>Now the Phariſees did queſtion in this manner, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſts Miniſtry, and therefore where ever he went they uſually followed him to hinder his Miniſtry, and they being ſilenced in their Objection in the former ſtory, they knowing <hi>John</hi> to be much in repute among the <hi>Jews,</hi> they get his Diſciples to propound this Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>We may obſerve, 1 The reſtleſneſs of Enemies of Truth, though conquered and beaten once and again, vet they give not over.</p>
                  <pb n="678" facs="tcp:171178:345"/>
                  <p n="2">2 See how cunning men, the Enemies of Chriſt, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to winde others into their party, ſo the Phariſees winde in <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples. Young Converts are ready to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through the craft of thoſe who <hi>ly in wait to deceive.</hi> See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 See that perſons are apt to pleaſe themſelves with their own cuſtomary ſervice, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.3, 5. they had taken up two Faſtes in the fifth and ſeventh moneth, for ſeventy years, and though they had nothing but Cuſtome for it, yet they ſend from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to make the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it a caſe of Conſcience. Beſides, when people have ſet up a golden Calf they would fain have others to worſhip it, and ſo <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples urge to have their faſting days obſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But thy Diſciples faſte not]</hi> That is, they eat and drink, ſecretly accuſing them of exceſs and intemperance; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.18. alludes to this. <hi>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and behold a Man gluttonous and a Wine-bibber: q. d.</hi> We are holy and of God, thou art a ſinner, whiles we are faſting thou art feaſting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>And</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſaid unto them, Can the Children of the Bride-chamber mourn ſo long as the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom is with them? but the days will come when the Bridegroom ſhall be taken from them, and then ſhall they faſte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is Chriſts meek Anſwer to them, as being weak and ſeduced, putting difference betwixt Seducers, and ſuch. Seducing Teachers are to be handled more roughly, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced more meekly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Can the Children of the Bride-chamber mourn]</hi> That is, thoſe that were admitted into the Bride-chamber with the Bridegroom, as Virgins were with the Bride, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45.14, 15. The ſum of Chriſts Anſwer is, Chriſt leaving the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, he anſwers onely <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples, ſhewing, that the cauſe why they faſted was not competent or agreeing to
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:171178:345"/>his Diſciples, but the time ſhould come when even his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, loſing their Maſter, ſhould mourn, mean time they had a little reſpite of joy and comfort, ſo long as he was with them. As mariages call for feaſting and gladneſs not for faſting and ſorrow, ſo did the preſence of Chriſt with his Diſciples, ſo that Chriſt his anſwer conſiſts of two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That at preſent his Diſciples had not cauſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe he the Bridegroom was with them. Obſerve that Chriſt is the Bridegroom of his Church, <hi>John</hi> 3.29. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. who did not onely eſpouſe our nature, and not the nature of Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. but alſo maries himſelf to every believing ſoul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. we are maried to him that was raiſed from the dead. <hi>John</hi> 6.37. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. This mariage is made up here on earth in the ſtate of grace, whereto there is a feaſt of grace and comfort as the begun ſolemnities thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2 2.2. and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heaven in the feaſt of eternal glory, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Chriſt anſwers, they ſhould have time of faſting and mourning in time to come. Chriſt taking away their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious faſting, doth neither cry up riot or exceſs, nor decry faſting, but that Chriſtians muſt apply themſelves to that condition the Lord ſends: When he gives glad times let us rejoyce in them, when he brings ſad times let us be humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſeek his face. Chriſt doth not decry faſting, as I ſaid, but he would not have it tied to certain times, as the Jews fondly did, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.3, 5. ſith, ſuch a day of the Moneth this year may be fit for faſting, but the next year the ſame day may call for feaſting. <hi>Jejuniorum diſſonantia non rumpat fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei conſonantiam.</hi> For as there were due caſes for faſting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament, as when ſome ſtroke of God was on a people, <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.26. when ſome judgement hang'd over a people, as <hi>Nineveh, Jon.</hi> 3.5. or to obtain ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular mercy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.31. Now theſe and ſuch like cauſes of
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:171178:346"/>faſting Chriſt doth not take away, but doth eſtabliſh them: yea and the Apoſtle practiſed them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. There's a tropological ſenſe, that when Chriſt our husband departs from us for our ſins, we ſhould then faſt and mourn, till we get his return, but the literal ſenſe is to be taken as that which is meant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 16. <hi>No man putteth a new piece of cloth into an old gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that which is put in to fill it up, taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worſe:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 17. <hi>Neither do men put new Wine into old bottles, elſe the bottles break and the Wine runneth out, and the bottles periſh; but they put new Wine into new bottles, and both are preſerved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's a third reaſon why Chriſt doth not require his Diſciples to faſte, which is their preſent weakneſs, which cannot well bear a more ſtrict diſcipline; the painfull duty of faſting doth not well ſuit with my Diſciples, being but babes, no more then a new piece doth with an old garment, or new Wine that is hot and working to be put into old bottles, this would be a means to make them fall off from me, and go back to the Phariſees, and therefore I refrain as yet from it, to avoid offence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertul. l. de orat. c.</hi> 1. By the old garment and old bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles underſtands the Old Teſtament, by the new piece the New Teſtament; for the new reformed the old, and made it as it were new, but I lean to the former.</p>
                  <p>Another is this. As a new piece doth not agree to an old garment, ſo your traditions of Fathers and Elders about your faſtings doth not agree to my Goſpel-doctrine, theſe will not warm our hearts, not quiet our conſciences, as the garment of my righteouſneſs doth. Moreover the mixture of humane inſtitutions and godlineſs or religion, will hazard the loſs of godlineſs and religion. The ancients kept their Wine in bottles made of leather and Skins, as we keep it in Casks; now when this is put in old bottles the Wine is apt
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:171178:346"/>to ſpill; ſo the doctrine of the Goſpel, when it falls into ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious mindes, is apt to be loſt.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpel is compared to Wine, both as Wine glads the heart, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. ſo doth the Goſpel; it's compared to new Wine, not becauſe it's new, being of old preached to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3.15. but in oppoſition to the old <hi>Adam,</hi> or corrupt nature in us, <hi>q. d.</hi> Goſpel truths do not agree to a man remaining in his old nature, but Goſpel truths are well agreeing to a regenerate nature, as new Wine to new bottles.</p>
                  <p>To communicate Goſpel truths to ſuch, is a double loſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Of the Wine, whiles unregenerate men reject the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, becauſe it's contrary to their luſts, or ſcandalize that Goſpel they profeſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The bottles are broken, that is, theſe men periſh, whiles by degrees they apoſtatize.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luke</hi> adds <hi>c.</hi> 5.39. <hi>No man having drunk old Wine ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way deſires new, for he ſaith the old is better.</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, it befals my doctrine as it befals them who have been accuſtomed to old Wine, for as they cannot endure new Wine, becauſe it hath a certain fowrneſs, ſo ye, being accuſtomed to old ſuperſtitions and pompous traditions, cannot away with my doctrine which is humble, ſharp and powerful, even to the renewing of the whole man, which when they are renewed then are they capable to receive the doctrine of the Goſpel. So that the ſum is, the doctrine of the Goſpel can neither be joyned with ceremonial ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces nor carnal natures: the Law of Ceremonies is made old like an old garment or old bottles, by my coming in the fleſh, therefore my Diſciples do well that they do not faſt according to the Law. Of theſe three interpretations I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the firſt and third.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 18. <hi>While he yet ſpake theſe things unto them, behold, there came a certain Ruler and worſhipped him, ſaying,

                  <p>Which is amplified, 1 From the time, which was whiles he was ſpeaking to the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> and the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.</p>

<pb n="684" facs="tcp:171178:348"/>ſo that he can make one or other bring us to Chriſt, ſo here the death of a daughter brings the ruler to Chriſt. Now that he ſaith his daughter was dead, he ſpake herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturally, conſidering how ſick ſhe was when Chriſt left her. Its like at firſt he cryed that ſhe was at the point of death. Now he cryes that ſhe was dead, upon the report the meſſengers brought, and becauſe when he left her ſhe was breathing out her ſoul or near thereto. And ſo we may reconcile <hi>Marks</hi> ſaying, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.23. <hi>She was at the point of death,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Matthews</hi> ſaying, <hi>ſhe was dead,</hi> ſo that the meſſenger that came, ſeeing the caſe deſperate, bids him <hi>that he would not trouble the Maſter,</hi> that is Chriſt: Chriſt therefore ſeeing him wavering in his faith and hope, ſtrengthens him, ſaying, <hi>Fear not, believe onely and ſhe ſhall be made whole, Luk.</hi> 8.50. ſo gracious is Chriſt to bear with the weakneſſes of his peoples faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But come and lay thy hand upon her and ſhe ſhall live]</hi> His faith was weaker then the Centurions. The Centurion believed that Chriſt, though abſent, with a word of his mouth could heal his ſervant, but <hi>Jairus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Come and lay thy hands on her.</hi> Here was the weakneſs of his faith that he limits Chriſts power to laying on of hands, yet are not perſons weak in faith to be rejected, but encouraged, as Chriſt doth encourage the ruler, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.50. Beſides its like he had ſeen or heard that Chriſt had healed ſundry perſons at <hi>Capernaum</hi> by laying on of hands, and therefore he hoped he would do the ſame to his daughter. Laying on of hands is an act, 1 Of power or dominion, 2 Of a will ready and inclining to do good, as to heal and help.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak a little concerning this doctrine of laying on of hands.</p>
                  <p>There is a threefold laying on of hands, 1 Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or healing. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. <hi>They ſhall lay hands on the ſick and they ſhall recover, Act.</hi> 28.8. <hi>Publius</hi> his Father being ſick, <hi>Paul prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</hi> It
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:171178:348"/>may be ſuppoſed the Apoſtle ſpeaks of this, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Is any among you ſick? let him ſend for the Elders of the Church and let them pray over him, anointing him with Oyl.</hi> So Chriſt <hi>Mark</hi> 6.5. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Ordinatory: there is a laying on of hands in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elders; this is acknowledged by all the reformed Churches of what judgement ſoever. Though Papiſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this to be an unblottable character, which who ſo hath can never blot it out again, yet the Proteſtants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it onely a ſigne, pointing out the perſon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, who is commended to the prayers of the Church. Hence that ſaying of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is ordinarily produced, <hi>Quid aliud eſt impoſitio manuum quam oratio ſuper hominem?</hi> what other thing is laying on of hands then prayer upon the man ordained?</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe two there is a third way, which I ſuppoſe comes nearer to truth, which is that by laying on of hands in ordination there is a further meaſure of the Spirit infuſed into, and poured upon the perſon ordained.</p>
                  <p>Concerning laying on of hands in ordination the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks, 1 Of thoſe who are ſent into the world, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>When they had faſted and prayed and laid their hands on them,</hi> they ſent them away. <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 On thoſe who are officers in Churches, as deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.6. The Apoſtles firſt prayed then laid their hands on them. So Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>And when they had ordained them Elders in every Church, by laying on of hands,</hi> (the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3 There is a laying on of hands on baptized perſons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſme; this hath been depraved, 1 By thoſe who have endeavoured to make working of miracles a conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant thereof, becauſe ſome perſons in the Apoſtles times
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:171178:349"/>after hands laid on them did ſpeak with tongues, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.6.7. and propheſied.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This laying on of hands hath been depraved by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> 1 By changing the name from laying on of hands to confirmation.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 Laying on of hands hath been depraved by the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal party, who, retaining the popiſh name of confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and affixing it to a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhop, inſtead of prayer for ſtrengthning of believers, 1 Lay hands upon infants or young children, 2 Suppoſing them all to be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate after Baptiſme, pray for an increaſe of grace on them, 3 Have added hereto God-Fathers as they call it.</p>
                  <p>Now, to prove laying on of hands on Baptized perſons is an apoſtolical inſtitution, I prove it,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe the Apoſtle makes it one of the ſix princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or the word of the beginning of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. Or <hi>the firſt rudiments or elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, Heb.</hi> 5.12. The words are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The Word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is onely explanatory, for the principles of all arts are
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:171178:349"/>called elements; nay, which is more, the Apoſtle calls it a foundation, as well as repentance, faith and Baptiſme, now the five others being fundamentals, wherein all converted perſons are to be practical in the belief, how can laying on of hands be excluded from being ſo received?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 If laying on of hands on Baptized perſons after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme be rejected, then inſtead of ſix principles laid down by the Apoſtle, we ſhall receive onely five, but this is abſurd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> but we acknowledge a laying on of hands in the call of miniſtry, therefore we acknowledge ſix.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> And why not as well after Baptiſme? what reaſon can be brought that miniſterial impoſition ſhould be here acknowledged, and the impoſition after Baptiſme exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? nay, it ſeemeth, impoſition after Baptiſme is rather meant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe as faith and repentance go together, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and the laſt judgement, ſo Baptiſme and laying on of hands go together in the Apoſtles joyning of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Laying on of hands upon officers is not herein meant, becauſe this was an adminiſtration the whole Church had received, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. but officers are not the whole Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe this laying on of hands is called <hi>milk for babes, Heb.</hi> 5.12, 13. but officers are not babes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe there is a command for it. 1 It's called the <hi>rudiments of the beginning,</hi> or <hi>elements of the beginning</hi> (he means not elements of the world, of which <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.3, 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8, 20.) that is, elements wherein perſons were initiated or begun in Chriſtianity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. As the elements of the Latin tongue is the learning of Accidence or Grammer, ſo this doctrine of laying on of hands was firſt to be taught and practiſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Its called an oracle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. Now what are oracles in Scripture language but commands? <hi>Act.</hi> 7.38. <hi>Moſes</hi> received the lively oracles to give unto us. This is called
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:171178:350"/>the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 53. <hi>Who have received the Law by the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Angels, and have not kept it,</hi> Rom. 3.2. <hi>What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage hath the Jew? Much every way, chiefly that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. <hi>If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God,</hi> that is, as the commands of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Apoſtle calls it a foundation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. ſo that there is not onely a virtual command, but an actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: from theſe three words of rudiments or elements, oracles, and foundation, I gather a plain command.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It appears from abſurdity. Is it not abſurd to think that one of the ſix foundation principles commended to us by the Apoſtle ſhould ceaſe, and all others of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the end of the world? Nay is not impoſition after Baptiſme placed in the midſt, betwixt faith and repentance, the reſurrection and laſt judgement, ſo that there is no coming to ſlight it, being fenced on every ſide, but we muſt renounce faith and repentance on the one ſide, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and laſt judgement on the other? Is it not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to think the Apoſtle would place one temporary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which was to laſt but for a ſmall time, among five perpetual principles, and yet call them all by the name of a foundation? yea ſuch a foundationas other things were to be laid after <hi>in eodem genere edificii,</hi> in the ſame kind of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let us go on to perfection,</hi> now what perfection doth he mean? truly a perfection of the knowledge of Chriſt, the foundation whereof was already laid. And ſo he did, for in the next place he comes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, the doctrine of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the heirs of promiſe, the doctrine of Chriſts prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 All the Churches were under laying on of hands, the Church of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> was under it, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12, 14, 17. compared. On the ſame Church of <hi>Samaria</hi> which was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, were hands laid. The Church of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had this as a principle firſt laid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.</p>
                  <pb n="689" facs="tcp:171178:350"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But how doth it follow to all the Churches?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> As we judg all the Churches were under Baptiſm, though we do not reade of any of the Church of <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> to have been baptized, yet becauſe we reade other Churches, we conclude alſo they were. So becauſe we finde theſe two Churches to have been under Laying on of Hands, we conclude all the Churches alſo ſo to have been, becauſe of the unity of the Rule. Now the Rule is plain, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14, 16, 17. When the Apoſtles heard that <hi>Samaria</hi> had received the Word of God, they ſent unto them <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who, when they were come down, prayed for <hi>them,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> might receive the Holy Ghoſt. The <hi>emphaſis</hi> lies in this Pronoun Relative <hi>they,</hi> the Antecedent whereto, muſt be the baptized <hi>Samaritans,</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, <hi>v.</hi> 12. alſo <hi>v.</hi> 16. it's ſaid, <hi>For as yet he was fallen upon none of them, onely they were baptized in the Name of the Lord</hi> Jeſus. So that Impoſition of Hands was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to all the baptized <hi>Samaritans, v.</hi> 17. <hi>Then laid they their Hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 The firſt Church ſhould be a Patern to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but the firſt Church continued in laying on of hands, therefore other Churches ought to continue herein. The Propoſition appears, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Ye, Brethren, became followers of the Churches of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. <hi>We have no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Churches of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Aſſumption appears, becauſe the Apoſtle calls it a <hi>Doctrine, Heb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>The Doctrine of Baptiſm and laying on of hands.</hi> Now the firſt Church continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. of which Doctrine this was part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But the firſt Church was ſcattered, and though there was a Church among the <hi>Hebrews, Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17, 24. <hi>Salute them that have the rule over you, and all the Saints,</hi> yet was not this Church the ſame, for <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1. <hi>There was a great Perſecution againſt the Church at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and they
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:171178:351"/>were all ſcattered through the Regions of</hi> Judea <hi>and</hi> Samaria, <hi>except the Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> All is oft in Scripture taken for a great part, and ſo I take it here. No doubt ſome could not fly, beſides they were ſcattered onely a little way, that is, into their own Countrey of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and could eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn when times proved peaceable, which by <hi>Pauls</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhortly fell out, for then had the Churches reſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. and were edified and multiplied. Beſides, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were never ſcattered from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who alone might make a Church had there been none elſe, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in his Book of Chaſtity, <hi>Ubi tres ibi Eccleſia eſt, licet Laici,</hi> where there are three there is a Church though Laicks, or People, therefore this Church in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> who were under laying on of hands and that in the <hi>Acts</hi> is the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 If laying on of hands were not an Ordinance of God, and of divine Inſtitution, then the Apoſtles in Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thereof had practiſed will-worſhip, nay, which is more, had left a Rule of will-worſhip unto us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. But it's abſurd to think the Apoſtles would do either of theſe, therefore laying on of hands on baptized perſons is an Apoſtolical Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But many of the Saints have received the Spirit without it, as the <hi>Antiochians, Acts</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> So have they without Baptiſm and the Supper, yet it's no ground to live without any of them, when we know them to be practiſed; beſides, they are Chanels to convey more of the Spirit unto us, I mean laying on of hands as well as Baptiſm.</p>

And it's no conſequence in the Scripture, there is a Promiſe, therefore we ſhould invent a mean through which it muſt be applied.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 In this Ordinance of Laying on of Hands there are two things, 1 The Prayer of Faith; the Promiſe is made to the Prayer of Faith, and no more to that Prayer of Faith than to other Prayers of Faith, wherein God is ſought to for gifts and graces.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Through this Laying on of Hands, as a mean, the gifts and graces of the Spirit are conveyed, when an Apoſtle layeth on his Hands on a fit believing ſubject. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou ſtir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on of the hands of me,</hi> as in the <hi>Greek.</hi> See he came to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gift of the Spirit by the Apoſtles laying on of his Hands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Here is no inventing of a mean to convey a Promiſe, but it is ſuch a mean as the Lord hath appointed to convey
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:171178:356"/>his Spirit: by ſuch a mean as the Apoſtle calls a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch a mean as was a Chanel of the Spirit to <hi>Timothy.</hi> Now as to the application of the Promiſe, no man can ſay that either Baptiſm, Supper, or Laying on of Hands apply the Promiſe. It's the Spirit and Faith alone that apply the Promiſes to the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 For Baptiſm and the Supper, concerning which there is more clearneſs of revelation, we dare not ſay they are means through which the graces of the Spirit muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, for God is a free Agent, but means through which the Spirit may be, and hath been conveyed; and the like we ſay of Laying on of Hands, as in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s caſe.</p>

And this may in all Ordinances ſtir us up to pray for it, becauſe God hath promiſed to pour out his Spirit in the times of the Goſpel, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17. <hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhall give you another Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father.</hi> See alſo <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>John</hi> 16.7, 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And touched the hem of his garment]</hi> It's like by a divine Impulſe.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. <hi>For ſhe ſaid within her ſelf, If I may but touch his garment I ſhall be whole.</hi>

                  <p>Yet is this nothing for the worſhipping the reliques of Saints, for it was not the touching the garment of Chriſt, but her faith that made her whole.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 That ſhe might know that ſhe was healed, not from the touching of his garment, but from Chriſt himſelf, who knowingly and wittingly healed her; hence Chriſt ſaith, virtue is not gone out of my garment, but out of me, Chriſt doth not give his Spirit to old raggs and clouts: had the virtue been in the garment it would have had the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on others that touched it. Chriſt was touched by her Faith. Many follow Chriſt that onely preſs him, but they onely touch him that lay hold on him by Faith, and know that Chriſt doth not as Princes, caſt their alms they know not to whom.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole]</hi> Chriſt helps the weakneſs of her Faith.

<pb n="704" facs="tcp:171178:358"/>fearing leaſt they be found out, ſo this woman. Now Chriſt encourages her, ſignifying withall that it was not her touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his garment but her perſwaſion of his divine power that conduced to her healing. Yet doth not every faith touch Chriſt, but that onely which is ſaving. Now as ſhe got healing, ſo we remiſſion of ſins by ſuch a faith in Chriſt, and as ſhe went away in peace hereby, ſo by faith in Chriſt we have peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.15.13.</p>

                  <p>The loſs of ſight is a great loſs. 1 Sight is the largeſt of ſenſes, whereas the ear onely takes in ſounds, the ſmelling takes in odours, but the eye takes in, not onely quantities
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:171178:361"/>and motions, but colour and figure. <hi>The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Sight is the moſt comfortable ſenſe. There are many glorious objects in Heaven and Earth, but little content ſhould we have, had we not ſight to behold them. Hence to behold the glorious objects of Heaven, the eys ſhall be raiſed up, ſo that we ſhall ſee our Redeemer, <hi>not with other, but with theſe eys, Job</hi> 19.26.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Sight is the moſt affective ſenſe. No ſenſe runs quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker into the ſpirits of men. Hence <hi>Jacob,</hi> though he heard <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, yet <hi>would go and ſee him before he dies, Gen.</hi> 45.28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Sight is the moſt ſatisfactory ſenſe. See how greatly the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was ſatisfied with what ſhe ſaw, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.4, 7. ſhe had heard of <hi>Solomons</hi> glory, but ſhe did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it till her eys had ſeen it, then ſhe breaks out, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>The ſight of the eys is better than the wandring of the deſire, Eccleſ.</hi> 6.9.</p>
                  <p>The affliction of theſe blinde men was the greater, in that they were deprived of this ſenſe; yet even ſuch ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have the want of ſeeing eys made up with ſight of minde, as <hi>Didymus</hi> St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> Maſter, who was comforted by a Friend that came to viſit him, that though he wanted the eys which Mice and Flies had, yet he had an intuitive mental ſight, which Angels had, by which God was ſeen.</p>
                  <p>About theſe blinde men conſider, 1 Their Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They followed Chriſt, and ſpake and cried unto him. Senſe of miſery ſhould make us importunate; ſo the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Cana, Matth.</hi> 15.22. and the Widow with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Judg. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Their faith. <hi>Thou Son of David have mercy on me.</hi> It was the ordinary ſtyle of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> for the Promiſes made to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12, 13, 16. <hi>I will ſet up thy ſeed after thee, and will eſtabliſh the throne of his kingdom for ever.
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:171178:361"/>Pſalm</hi> 89.3, 4. <hi>I have ſworn unto</hi> David <hi>my ſervant, thy ſeed will I eſtabliſh for ever, and build up thy throne to all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Pſalm</hi> 132.11. Hence the children cried, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of</hi> David, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.16. Now the People judged by the great Miracles Chriſt did, that he was this Son of <hi>David, John</hi> 7.31. The People believed on him, and ſaid, <hi>When Chriſt cometh, will he do more Miracles than thoſe which this man hath done?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As theſe blinde men ſaw the God-head of Chriſt ſhine forth in his Miracles, ſo ſaw they the humane nature of Chriſt, in that he was <hi>Davids</hi> Son; and ſo they reſted on him as the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> both God and Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 28. <hi>And when he was come into the houſe, the blinde men came unto him, and</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſaith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? they ſay unto him, Yea Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt defers the anſwering of them to try their faith and patience, hence he anſwered them not in the way, till they came to the houſe where he was, which was at <hi>Capernaum, c.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Believe ye that I am able to do this?] Queſt.</hi> Whether belief of Gods power without the mercy of God be the object of our faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt ſaw their belief of Gods mercy, becauſe they deſired mercy, and becauſe they acknowledged him, to be the <hi>Meſsiah;</hi> the doubt lay onely about Chriſts power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They ſay unto him, Yea Lord]</hi> Where there is a belief of Gods power, there is a knowledg, in ſome meaſure, that we do believe it. Faith is like a Bucket, every faith draws ſomething from God; the greater the Bucket is the more is drawn at a time. Yet doth a weak faith receive Chriſt, and his benefits, as a weak Palſey ſhaking hand is able to receive a pardon.</p>
                  <pb n="712" facs="tcp:171178:362"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 29. <hi>Then touched he their eys, ſaying, According to your faith be it unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Chriſt may ſtir them up to examine their faith, he tells them that they ſhall receive according to it, withall puts a difference betwixt the meritorious cauſe of their healing, which was himſelf, and the Inſtrument apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and receiving this benefit which was their faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 And withall ſhews that faith doth not go empty hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God. <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>He that comes to me I will in no wiſe caſt off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 30. <hi>And their eys were opened, and</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſtraitly charged them, ſaying, See that no man know it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Their eys were opened]</hi> Not their ey-lids but their eys; ſome skin growing over, Chriſt with his touch healed and gave them a perfect power of ſight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſtraitly charged them, ſaying, See that no man know it]</hi> That is, till I give you leave to divulge it.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons were, 1 Leſt the Phariſees ſhould, being moved with envy, cauſe him preſently to depart, as ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That, after his Doctrine had been further preached, this and divers other Miracles might come out together, and the matter be ſo much more ſtupendous, as it was in <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who hid her ſelf five moneths, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To teach us ſobriety that we ſhould be ready to do good in ſecret, though no preſent praiſe ſhould accompany our ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 31. <hi>But they, when they were departed, ſpread abroad his fame in all that Countrey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether did the blinde men well herein?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In no wiſe. Whatſoever good meanings they might have, of promoting the glory of Chriſt, or of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thoſe who queſtioned them how they came to their ſight, yet ought they to keep cloſe to the command of Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.24, 25. No ſacrifice is like obedience: they
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:171178:362"/>were not called to ſpread the Name of Chriſt to others, hence they ſinned. Every ſoul that ſpreads the Name of Chriſt had need to look to his and their call. Some perſons have no call at all. Wicked perſons have no call <hi>to take Gods name in their mouth,</hi> nor godly men neither, in theſe caſes wherein they are expreſly forbid.</p>
                  <p>Let not any pretence in the world exempt us from a plain command of God, not the ſaving of our liberties, lives, eſtates, no not the promoting the glory of Chriſt. Not to ly for God, <hi>Job</hi> 13.6, 7. It was a good ſpeech of a late Prince in this Nation, <hi>Sin not againſt Conſcience no not for the ſake of the holy Trinity.</hi> The works of Chriſt are to be publiſhed abroad, but not againſt an expreſs command of Chriſt. And ſo much more cautelous ſhould we be, when we are ſtraitly charged not to violate this or that command, as the blinde men were here ſtraitly charged or threatened, as Expoſitors render the word: though all the commands of Chriſt are grounded upon reaſon, yet are we not too curiouſly to pry into the reaſon of the commands, as probably theſe blinde men might do, as to look to the command it ſelf. If it be interpreted to be ſawcineſs to diſpute the commands of men, who are over us, what ſawcineſs is it then to diſpute the commands of the Lord? Neither can the blinde mens good intention excuſe them, for <hi>Uzzah</hi> had the ſame, and <hi>Paul</hi> in perſecuting the Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.11. nor yet their zeal, for the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſtabliſhing their own righteouſneſs, had the zeal of God herein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2, 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 32. <hi>As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man poſſeſſed with a Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Hiſtory we have theſe things, 1 A dumb man poſſeſſed with a Devil brought to Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 32.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The caſting out the Devil by Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The effects hereof, 1 <hi>The multitudes marvelled, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, It was never ſo ſeen in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>v.</hi> 34.</p>
                  <pb n="714" facs="tcp:171178:363"/>
                  <p n="2">2 The Phariſees blaſphemed, ſaying, <hi>He caſteth out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils through the Prince of the devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A dumb man]</hi> That is deaf and dumb, for they that are deaf from their birth are wont to be dumb, for they that cannot hear cannot learn words to expreſs themſelves, There were many perſons would not believe there were any devils, as Sadduces and others: for the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of theſe, when they ſhall ſee ignorant men poſſeſſed to ſpeak ſtrange languages, they never learned, as <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> they may ſee there are devils. This cure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt hath a <hi>Behold</hi> put upon it. It's probable that this man was not dumb from his birth, but made dumb by the devil, becauſe, when the devil was caſt out the dumb ſpake.</p>
                  <p>Now if you ask why God would ſuffer the devil to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs men? It is to let us ſee the power that the devil hath in poſſeſſed men, for look as when he poſſeſſes the body he makes one blinde, another deaf and dumb, and bindes a third that they cannot move themſelves, as he did that daughter of <hi>Abraham, Luke</hi> 13.16. for eighteen years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo Satan when he reigns in the hearts of natural men, he makes them blinde, dumb, deaf, and ſenſeleſs, to all ſpiritual things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 33. <hi>And when the devil was caſt out, the dumb ſpake, and the multitudes marvelled, ſaying, It was never ſo ſeen in Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath given us our tongues to ſound forth his praiſes, and means whereby we may edifie one another; hence thoſe Satan cannot draw to blaſphemy, railing, filthy ſpeaking, he lays ſnares for to make them dumb, as it's like he did this poor man.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt doth not require faith of this poſſeſſed man, as he did of the blinde men, becauſe he was dumb and deaf, and being deaf he could neither hear nor anſwer; but Chriſt, upon the intreaty of thoſe who brought him, healed him.
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:171178:363"/>Chriſt requires of us onely acording to the means he gives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Devil was caſt out]</hi> For the manner of the caſting out of the devil the Text is ſilent, it's like Chriſt commanded the devil to come out of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Multitudes marvelled, ſaying, It was never ſo ſeen in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael] Hyperbole,</hi> for Chriſt had done greater miracles, from which the multitude did not derogate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 But the ſcope of the preſent wonderment was to ſtir up one another to look on him as the <hi>Meſsiah.</hi> Wonder was the beginning of Philoſophy; <hi>Propter admirari coeperunt homines Philoſophari,</hi> here wonder was the beginning of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To extol Chriſt above any of the old Prophets, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias, Iſaias, Jeremy,</hi> &amp;c. none of whom had done ſo many and ſo great miracles. Chriſt ſpent a whole day in doing miracles. Chriſt did not lay ſtaff upon the ſick, nor cover them with his garment, but cured them with his Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 34. <hi>But the Phariſees ſaid, He caſteth out devils through the Prince of the devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look as the Sun, Moon and Stars, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the ſubject, have variety of influences, the Sun ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens wax, hardens clay, they beget one thing and corrupt another; ſo the Sermons and Miracles of Chriſt, which ſtir'd up admiration and reverence in the multitude, in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees ſtir up oppoſition and blaſphemy. One cauſe brings forth diverſity of effect, as the Word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Phariſees ſaid, He caſteth out devils]</hi> Here was their blaſphemy, not far from the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, if not the very ſame, out of malice to aſcribe that to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil which was done by the finger of God. Men that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly affected will calumniate the moſt glorious works of God, yea and ſpeak againſt Preachers and their Sermons and expoſitions, how godly ſoever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Through the Prince of the devils]</hi> The Prince of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:171178:364"/>is the ſame that is called the Prince of this world, <hi>John</hi> 12.31. As there is an order among the good Angels, ſo is there among the devils, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. Thus did the Phariſees blaſpheme, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.15. againſt whom Chriſt ſufficiently diſputes, <hi>That if Satan caſt out Satan, how can then his Kingdome ſtand?</hi> Now this Prince of the devils is the ſame that elſewhere is called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the god of Flies, an idol of the <hi>Ekronites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 35. <hi>And Jeſus went about all the Cities and Villages, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the Synagogues, and preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdome, and healing every ſickneſs, and every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe among the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have four things conſiderable to the end of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The mercifull and charitable affection of Chriſt, in that he went about all the Cities and Villages, preaching the Goſpel and healing their diſeaſes, therein ſhowing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to their ſouls and bodies, <hi>v.</hi> 35.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The motive that moved him thereto, which was his compaſſion, or his yerning bowels, <hi>v.</hi> 36. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the word. Compaſſion is the feeling of another mans paſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The object of this compaſſion, it was forlorn ſouls who were as ſheep without a Shepherd. For though they had <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> and many others Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſees, who boaſted themſelves to be Paſtors, yet Chriſt did not acknowledge them ſo to be.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The remedy Chriſt propounds for relieving theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed ſouls, which was, that Chriſt ſpeaks unto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and in them to all other Chriſtians, who were potent with God, to pray to the Lord of the Harveſt to ſend forth labourers.</p>
                  <p>Two grounds Chriſt gives for our ſo praying,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The greatneſs of the harveſt, multitudes of hearers not yet converted, and many converted perſons who ſtand need of building up.</p>
                  <pb n="717" facs="tcp:171178:364"/>
                  <p n="2">2 The fewneſs of labourers, that is of ſuch who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and willing to work in Gods Vineyard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus went about all the Cities]</hi> Here's Chriſt his unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riedneſs in doing the Lords work. It appears they had Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues both in Cities and Villages, <hi>John</hi> 18.20. Jeſus ſaid, <hi>I ſpoke openly to the world, I ever taught in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and in the Temple, whither the Jews always reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing.</hi> Now Chriſt went up and down to preach among them. Where people have any deſire after means of grace, ſome help ſhould be afforded to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. When <hi>Paul</hi> in a Viſion ſaw a man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> ſaying, <hi>Come over and help us, Paul</hi> gathered that he had a call to go thither.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, becauſe the Apoſtles and Chriſt could not go every where, they vvent onely to the Cities and Villages, that from thence the Goſpel might be ſcattered up and down in the Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Villages]</hi> For even the ſouls of perſons in Villages ought to be precious; ſuch was <hi>Cenchrea</hi> a Village and Haven near to <hi>Corinth.</hi> Many Preachers thruſt together in Cities for outward accommodations, yea even there vvhere their Miniſtry is loathed, vvhiles many poor breathing ſouls in the Villages are hunger ſtarved. There may be a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Teachers herein, who are heartleſs in preaching, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have a numerous auditory to hear; vve may deſire to preach to many, becauſe vvhere there are many in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſome vvil be gained; yet not to preach onely to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for vvhere the Goſpel comes but now and then, people are apt to receive it vvith more reliſh: as in fiſhing ſo in preaching, in freſh vvaters vvhere the net is caſt ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome there is now and then the greateſt draught of fiſh, ſo where the Goſpel comes but ſeldome, perſons often highly eſteem it, vvhiles the commonneſs of <hi>Manna</hi> begets a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides poor people in Villages have not ſo much proud
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:171178:365"/>arguments againſt the Goſpel as thoſe who live in Cities have. Let no man think himſelf too good to preach in Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, conſidering the Lord Chriſt hath gone before herein, and conſidering the vvorth of a ſoul. Chriſt vvas both a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſt of and a Preacher to poor Country people. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> preached in the Villages of the <hi>Samaritans, Acts</hi> 8.25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdome]</hi> So called becauſe the ſubject matter of it is to hold forth the Kingdome of Grace and Glory. 2 Becauſe it holds forth the means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Healing every ſickneſs and every diſeaſe]</hi> There's a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt ſickneſs and diſeaſe. Sickneſs is any diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered inequality of humours, whereby the body is more or leſs diſabled from its proper ſervice. Diſeaſe is ſome mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that affects us in one kinde, as fever, conſumption. Chriſt healed all theſe, 1 That perſons might ſee his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, while no ſickneſs nor diſeaſe was too hard for him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That having their bodily maladies cured they might ſeek to him for their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 36. <hi>But, when he ſaw the multitudes, he was moved with compaſsion to them, becauſe they fainted, and were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad as ſheep having no Shepherd.</hi>

Chriſt hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:171178:366"/>the minds of the Diſciples to go out to preach. Herein are two arguments.</p>

Hence have they a due right to their maintenance. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> reſerved the Prieſts living, <hi>Jezebel</hi> maintained four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred falſe Prophets, <hi>Micha</hi> maintained a <hi>Levite:</hi> the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> had not near the ſervice we have, yet was his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance greater then any of the Tribes.

                  <head>Cauſes why ſo few labourers.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 Love of eaſe; whereas much ſtudy is a wearineſs to the fleſh, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.12. Offer not that to God which coſts thee nothing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Inability of hearers to difference betwixt doctrine and doctrine, hence ſuperficial, raw, indigeſted notions are
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:171178:367"/>as well or better liked then ſolid and ſubſtantial truths.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The diſcouragement that Preachers in many places finde; every man elſe is incouraged but they diſcouraged, partly from the cenſures that paſs upon their doctrine, and partly from ſtrait-handedneſs. Every calling, as Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, Lawyer is rewarded, onely what preachers have in many places is counted as alms, hence there are but few la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, and were it not for conſcience towards God there would be much fewer.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The ſtrictneſs of the account, that they muſt anſwer for the ſouls committed to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The multitude of buſineſs that lyes upon a faithful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer. What a buſineſs is it to make one ſoul lye level upon Chriſt? ſometimes full of fears and doubts for want of comfort, ſometimes falling into ſpiritual pride in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it, ſometimes wraſtling with an angry God, ſometimes conflicting with a ſcrupulous conſcience, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſoul thinks all he hath done is in vain, and that he is caſt out of Gods ſight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. One wants know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, another comfort, another reproof; one is a babe, another a grown man. Now the work being ſo weighty, few that know the weight of it are forward to venture on it, it being a burden too heavy for the ſhoulders of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> complained in his time that perſons would not take the over ſight of flocks, but perſons betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Merchants,<note place="margin">Hiſtory of <hi>Trent.</hi>

                  <p>Preaching is counted the eaſieſt buſineſs (and as many uſe it ſo it is) but to preach that our words may be as goads to the dull Ox, and as nails to the faſtening of inſtructions,

                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 38. <hi>Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harveſt that he would ſend forth</hi> (or in the Greek, <hi>caſt forth</hi>) <hi>labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into his harveſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt here propounds a remedy for the want above mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> to pray to the Lord of the harveſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt hereby not onely informes us of the backwardneſs of men herein, but alſo pricks on the Apoſtles and others to accept of ſuch a call.</p>
                  <p>Moreover here is ſignified not onely a diſpoſing provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſend teachers to this or that place, but alſo a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of ſpecial power with peculiar commands and gifts, which well agrees with the call of the Apoſtles in the next chapter. As the Embaſſadors of Princes are directed to their reſidence, and their continuance determined by the Prince how long they ſhall remain, ſo are teachers diſpoſed of God in like manner. He carries them from one place to another, <hi>Jonah</hi> from <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Nineveh.</hi>

                  <p>Strive we then to be fervent with God in prayer herein: as a faithful teacher is one of the greateſt bleſſings, ſo the contrary is a great curſe. We are earneſt with God for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, O ſtrive to be earneſt for this. But becauſe wants ſet an edge upon prayer, lay open before the Lord thy ſix or ſeven children, and three or four ſervants, who

We preach to perſons to turn from darkneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. but God turns them. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> preached a long time, <hi>Iſai</hi> 53.1. yet becauſe the arm of the Lord, or the power of the Lord, was not revealed to ſouls, there were ſo few converted, that he cries out, <hi>Who hath believed our reports?</hi> yea he and the children God had given him were as ſigns and wonders. If God go along <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall at one Sermon convert three thouſand. All our Preaching is but as the rigging of the Sails, which avails not unleſs the Winde blow. When he opens none can ſhut, when he ſhuts none can open. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7, 8. yet muſt we in a patient manner make trial what ſucceſs God will give us in our Miniſtry, imitating <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 5.5. who had toiled all night and taken nothing, yet would at Chriſts word further let down the net. And truly perſons ſent by God uſually have their labours bleſſed to the converting and building up of ſome ſouls. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21, 22.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 It is the Lord that maintains them in their work, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.9, 10. <hi>Be not affraid, but ſpeak and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee.</hi> He holds the ſeven ſtars in his right hand, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.16, 20. now the right hand is the hand of ſtrength and power, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.18, 19. ſaith God to <hi>Jeremy, I have made thee an Iron Pillar and a Brazen Wall, they ſhall fight againſt thee, but not prevail.</hi> Seeing God maintains perſons herein, it's fit he have the ſending of them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>WE have in this Chapter three things to be premiſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The occaſion and coherence, which was, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes coming to Chriſt with deſire to hear the Goſpel, he was moved with compaſſion towards them, <hi>cap.</hi> 9.7. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as Sheep without a Shepherd, he conſults to ſend out his Diſciples, and therefore before he ſends them forth, he bids them <hi>pray to the Lord of the Harveſt to ſend forth La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers,</hi> which the Diſciples doubtleſs did; hence as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of their prayers, Chriſt as the Lord of the Harveſt ſends forth Labourers, even his twelve Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That there is difference betwixt this ſending and the election of the twelve, mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 6. when Chriſt choſe them that he might inſtruct them, that in time to come they might be ſent out: Chriſt will have thoſe whom he ſends out firſt to be Diſciples before he will ſend them out: he mentions not here their chuſing, but onely their ſending, becauſe he had choſen them before.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That this ſending forth of the twelve Diſciples or Apoſtles differs from that ſending forth of the twelve, mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. this being onely particular, that they ſhould go into the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> that being for them to go into all the World, and was to continue till the end of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. Contrarily this ſending may ſeem to be onely temporary, and that the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here and there do <hi>tota ſpecie,</hi> in the whole kinde differ, and that that is not an enlargement of this commiſſion but another.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe at this ſending Chriſt impowers them to preach and do Miracles, but there he impowers them to make Diſciples and baptize them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Becauſe theſe are forbidden not to go into the way of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor into any City of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> but the
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:171178:370"/>twelve ſent out <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. are commanded to make Diſciples all Nations, and to preach the Goſpel to every creature, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. theſe were onely to go to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe theſe were to make no manner of proviſions for their Journey, of Gold, Silver nor Braſs in their Purſes, but the Preachers in the following order of the Scripture are required to be hoſpitable; now they cannot do this unleſs they have wherewithall to do it, as Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> alſo to make all proviſions, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.35.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Becauſe here are onely barely named twelve, and no proviſion for others after them, as there is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. nor no precept unto any other Preacher but unto them.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It appears from <hi>Luke</hi> 22.35. <hi>When I ſent you forth without Scrip, wanted ye any thing?</hi> and they ſaid, Nothing. But now, he that hath a Purſe let him take it, and likewiſe a Scrip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where the word <hi>have ſent</hi> ſignifies the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be at an end, and the word <hi>now</hi> imports another different command to be given to them.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The Apoſtles, when they went to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were not at firſt received, till they had ſeen their Miracles and holineſs, and therefore before they brought them over to the faith they muſt carry proviſions for themſelves and their company, which many times was not ſmall. See <hi>Acts</hi> 20.4.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, It was a cuſtome among the <hi>Jews</hi> to provide for their Maſters, therefore Chriſt bids them carry nothing when they went to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but that cuſtome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> they had power to carry provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The ſufferings hereafter mentioned, from <hi>v.</hi> 16. did not befall the Apoſtles in their firſt ſending: in the firſt ſending the Apoſtles found no perſecution to fly from one City to another, but all things ſucceeded according to their
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:171178:371"/>deſire, they joying that the Devils were ſubject to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17. but in this ſending they are bid to prepare for perſecution and death.</p>
               <p>Reaſons to prove that this ſending was perpetual and part of that commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. which was after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged;</p>
               <p n="1">1 From the providential care which Chriſt had for theſe Apoſtles, that when he ſent them forth without any thing, they wanted nothing, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.35. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, When I ſent you without Purſe, and Scrip, and Shoes, lacked ye any thing?</hi> and they ſaid, Nothing. So why will not Chriſt have the ſame care of Goſpel Preachers if they durſt truſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Becauſe the twelve at this ſending were commanded to ſhake off the duſt of their feet againſt that houſe or any that did not receive them, and this was performed long after Chriſts Reſurrection and Aſcenſion (and after the giving of the commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.) by <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13.50, 51. when perſecution drove <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> from the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> and the coaſts thereof, they ſhook off the duſt of their feet againſt them, as Chriſt here commanded, <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe the ſeventy afterwards have the ſame Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.9, 10, 11. that the twelve had.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Becauſe the ſame temptations which Chriſt fences theſe Apoſtles againſt, to wit, poverty and perſecution, are the temptations which in all ages faithfull Preachers are liable unto.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Becauſe theſe following precepts given to theſe twelve are of no leſs concernment to the Preachers of following ages than to theſe twelve, <hi>viz. Be wiſe as Serpents, v.</hi> 16. <hi>Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to Counſels, v.</hi> 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Arguments on both ſides I ſhall leave the matter, onely I declare, I rather incline to think that this
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:171178:371"/>fending was onely temporary for the fore-mentioned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>We have in this Chapter three parts. 1 The ſending forth of the twelve Apoſtles, from <hi>v.</hi> 1. to 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2 A caution to them thus ſent out in particular, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. and in general to all Chriſtians, for ſo <hi>Luke</hi> expounds it, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.1, to <hi>v.</hi> 13. That they ſhould ſpeak what he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them <hi>in the ear, upon the houſe top, and not to fear them that can onely kill the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 An encouragement of them in particular, and of all Chriſtians in general, againſt ſlaviſh fear, from <hi>v.</hi> 16. to the end.</p>
               <p>In the ſending forth of the Apoſtles, obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Their names, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Their call, Jeſus ſent them forth and commanded them, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The place whereto they are deſigned, to wit the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, <hi>But go not in the way of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles nor into any City of the Samaritans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Their power, which was, 1 To preach, amplified from the ſubject matter of it, <hi>The Kingdome of heaven is at hand, v.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To do miracles, <hi>viz. Heal the ſick, cleanſe the Lepers, raiſe the dead, caſt out devils, v.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="5">5 From their maintenance in their work, ſet down;</p>
               <p n="1">1 Negatively, 1 They ſhould not take any thing for their preaching, nor for the miracles they wrought, <hi>v.</hi> 9. 2 They ſhould not provide gold, nor ſilver, nor braſs in their purſes, nor ſcrip to cary proviſions, nor two coats <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Poſitively, 1 That where ever they wrought the Lords work, they ſhould expect all due proviſion, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>For the workman is worthy of his meat.</hi> 2 That there ſhould ſtill be worthy perſons that would be ready to receive and give them harbour, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. 3 The wofull conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them that ſhould not receive them and relieve them,
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:171178:372"/>
                  <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>It ſhould be more tolerable for</hi> Sodome <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah <hi>in the day of judgement, then for that people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 1. <hi>And when he had called unto him his twelve Diſciples, he gave them power againſt unclean ſpirits, and to heal all manner of ſickneſs, and all manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when he called his twelve Diſciples together, he gave them power againſt unclean ſpirits]</hi> Chriſt ſending out his Diſciples to preach, furniſhes them thereunto. Beſides an ability to preach, he inables them to do miracles for the confirmation of their doctrine; he makes them of Scholers to be Maſters, having in private firſt inſtructed them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The power Chriſt gave them was not onely <hi>Potentia</hi> or an <hi>ability,</hi> but it was alſo <hi>Poteſtas</hi> an <hi>authority.</hi> Some have power to do a thing that have not authority, and ſome have authority that have not power: the Diſciples had a derivative power to do miracles, Chriſt had this power from himſelf.</p>
               <p>Devils are called unclean ſpirits, as being full of pride and hatred of God, and envy againſt men, and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the holy Angels, and becauſe they delight in uncleanneſs, and make men unclean, defiling with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the minde, rebellion in the will.</p>
               <p>We may ſee here the power of Chriſt above <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. <hi>Moſes</hi> when he brought his Law did ſundry miracles, and ſo did Chriſt, but neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets could give power to others to do miracles, as Chriſt here doth. Beſides Chriſt had power and gave power over devils, which none elſe did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>Now the names of the twelve Apoſtles are theſe: The firſt</hi> Simon, <hi>who is called</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> Andrew <hi>his brother,</hi> James <hi>the ſon of</hi> Zebedee, <hi>and</hi> John <hi>his brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Names of the twelve Apoſtles]</hi> They were twelve, that as the twelve Patriarchs were the fathers of the Jews, ſo theſe
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:171178:372"/>were the fathers of all Chriſtians. Hence when <hi>Judas</hi> was dead, <hi>Matthias</hi> was choſen in his place, and Chriſt being about to build his ſpiritual Kingdome, ſets forth the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Jewiſh Commonwealth, to denote that the promiſes of the everlaſting Kingdome are fulfilled in him.</p>
               <p>It was alſo needfull for us to know their names, from whoſe agreeing teſtimony the Truth was to be received, many pretending an Apoſtleſhip which proved to be falſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt, Simon who is called Peter]</hi> Not in reſpect of dignity but order; for among the Preachers of the Goſpel there muſt be a priority of order, though no ſupremacy of Juriſdiction; for <hi>Peter</hi> diſclaims it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lords over Gods heritage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet what is this to the primacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop? for how doth it follow that <hi>Peter</hi> had a primacy of age, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, and therefore had a primacy of authority? and how doth it follow more to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> then to the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> might be called firſt, becauſe firſt called to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, though <hi>Andrew</hi> was called before him to Diſciple-ſhip, his primacy might be alſo in reſpect of faith and confeſſion, not in reſpect of honour and degree. Alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>James</hi> is ſet before <hi>Peter,</hi> and at the Council <hi>Acts</hi> 15. they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to <hi>James</hi> his ſentence. And <hi>Andrew, Philip,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel</hi> did acknowledge Chriſt before <hi>Peter, John</hi> 1.41, 45, 49. did acknowledge him. And though <hi>Peter</hi> made that confeſſion that Chriſt was the ſon of the living God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. yet did he ſpeak in behalf of all the Apoſtles. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 6, 69, 70. <hi>We believe and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simon called Peter]</hi> To diſtinguiſh him from <hi>Simon</hi> the Canaanite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Andrew]</hi> So called from his virility and nobleneſs, in

                  <hi>V.</hi> 5. <hi>Theſe twelve Jeſus ſent forth, and commanded them ſaying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the Samaritans enter ye not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe twelve</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſent forth</hi>] That is theſe men of mean quality, Fiſhermen, to confound the wiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles]</hi> The ſcope of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was to ſtir up the <hi>Jews</hi> to the hope of their ſalvation now at hand by Chriſt, and to make them attentive to hear him: therefore Chriſt limits them to <hi>Judaea,</hi> becauſe Chriſt was ſent from the Father as the miniſter of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, to fulfill the promiſes made unto the Jewiſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. Therefore Chriſt at firſt would have the doctrine of grace preached onely to this people, but after his reſurrection, when the vail was taken away, he would have it preached to all nations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.8.</p>
               <p>Beſides, had Chriſt ſent his Diſciples to preach to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as to them, they would have excepted againſt Chriſt, from being the <hi>Mesſias,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Mesſias</hi> was onely promiſed unto the <hi>Jews</hi> and not unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But was it not unjuſt to deny means of ſalvation to the Gentiles?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, for God hath power to do with his own what he pleaſeth. 2 God is not bound to give means ſave where he pleaſeth: gifts are diſpenſed according to the will of the giver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did Chriſt forbid his diſciples to go to the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and yet he himſelf would go to them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them? <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It might be becauſe they were in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the reſt of the heathen, and ſo the Goſpel was not to be given to them at firſt. 2 Or elſe becauſe Chriſt himſelf intended to go thither, therefore there was no need for his Diſciples to go thither.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Chriſt did not wholly forbid his Diſciples to go to
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:171178:374"/>the Gentiles, but onely that the firſt fruits of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſhould be given to the <hi>Jews. Act.</hi> 13.46.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> were neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor Gentiles, but a mixture of Jewiſh and Gentile Religion together, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.24.33.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 6. <hi>But go ye rather to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Chriſt was ſent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.24. By theſe loſt ſheep Chriſt means the Tribes of <hi>Juda, Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who came back out of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, to whom ſundry of the other Tribes joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or at leaſt the godly among them: he calls them loſt ſheep, becauſe they wanted good paſtors and teachers: after his reſurrection he tells his Diſciples <hi>that they ſhould be his witneſſes in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the uttermoſt parts of the earth, Act.</hi> 1.8. Mean time, they, as all other preachers ought to do, muſt contain themſelves in the bounds of their lawful calling, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Feed the flock of God which is among you. Feed the flock over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were called ſheep, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.1.79.13.80.1. They were called loſt, becauſe every man by nature is in a loſt condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.3, 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. Sundry of theſe were reprobates, yet called by the name of ſheep, becauſe they were adopted unto God for a people, and were a national Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>And as ye go preach, ſaying, The Kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here was the ſumme of the preaching Chriſt enjoyned theſe twelve, to wit, whereas the Jews expected a carnal and temporal kingdom, wherein, by the driving out the <hi>Romans</hi> and all their other enemies, the <hi>Mesſias</hi> would place them, Chriſt therefore bids his Diſciples tell them, that though there were a glorious Kingdom promiſed to the <hi>Jews</hi> upon earth, yet that kingdom being far off, there was another kingdom near at hand, wherein the Lord
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:171178:375"/>Jeſus ſhould throw down Satans kingdom, and ſet up his own, tranſlating his people thereinto, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that with a willing mind they ſhould receive this king, not onely by his power and providence ruling in the world, but alſo ruling in their hearts, every purpoſe by true and unfained repentance being brought under his government, which other tearms expreſs thus, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. <hi>That repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remisſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither did the twelve onely repeat theſe words, but under them is expreſſed the benefits by Chriſt, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of receiving and applying Chriſt and his benefits, the reſurrection, laſt judgement, heaven, hell, the burning of the world, the denial of our ſelves both in luſts and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the future puniſhment that would betide thoſe who refuſed the preſent grace offered. But becauſe faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance was the preparation to this kingdom, doubtleſs they inſiſted hereupon eſpecially. Great is the benefit of faithfull preaching, which makes the kingdom of God which was far from us to be nigh unto us. By this preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is that loſt ſheep are brought home into Chriſts fold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V.</hi> 8. <hi>Heal the ſick, cleanſe the Lepers, raiſe the dead, caſt out Devils; freely ye have received, freely give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt ſhows that his diſciples ſhould uſe the power of doing miracles together with their preaching, with all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and readineſs, that they ſhould not ſpare their mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles when there was any need thereof, when they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired thereto, or their doctrine ſtood need of confirmation, for hereby they ſhould not onely get authority to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but good will to their perſons, and theſe miracles ſhould ſupply their want of learning and language. There are many whom other adjurers, and inchanters, and your witches could not cure, very many of our men, I ſay, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have healed and do heal, adjuring them by the name of Jeſus Chriſt Crucified under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> diſarming and
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:171178:375"/>caſting out devils from men that have poſſeſſed them. <hi>Juſt. Mart. Apol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 35. The power of his name Devils fear and tremble, who being adjured by the name of Chriſt Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> obey us. <hi>Juſt. cont. Triph, p.</hi> 191. ſee the ſame, <hi>p.</hi> 235. alſo <hi>p.</hi> 243. and <hi>Juſtin</hi> adds, if you adjure devils by the name of your kings, prophets, or righteous men, they will not be caſt out. Now as when God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bring them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he enabled him to do ſundry miracles to gain belief to his words, and that the people might know he was ſent of God, ſo doth Chriſt give his Diſciples the like power for the ſame end.</p>
               <p>Onely whereas ſome of <hi>Moſes</hi> miracles were for terror, the miracles of the Diſciples were profitable and beneficial to thoſe who partook of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give]</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, The ſcholers of Phyſicians get the skill of healing diſeaſes with a great expence of time and ſtudy, and not without great charge of money, but you have received this power in a moment, without any coſt or labour, therefore having received freely, give freely. You muſt not make ſale of miracles to covetouſneſs or vain glory, for he well knew how the heart of ſome of them, to wit <hi>Judas,</hi> hung after money, and the ſeeds of covetouſneſs, as well as other ſins were in the hearts of the reſt. So <hi>Eliſha</hi> would take nothing of <hi>Naaman</hi> for healing his Leproſie, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.16. and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezi</hi> taking money herein was ſmit with the ſame Leproſie. When <hi>Magus</hi> would have bought this power, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee,</hi> Act. 8.20.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Reaſons why they might take nothing for doing miracles.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 The ſelling of them perverts the end wherefore they were given, which was not to ſatisfie any mans covetous luſt, but to confirm the Goſpel.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 That whiles ſuch Miracles were done freely, the name of God might be more glorified, and the Doctrine which they confirmed accepted; for men do leſs eſteem thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which themſelves in ſome ſort can recompenſe.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether doth this precept, <hi>Freely you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, freely give,</hi> belong to one or both theſe precepts, or to the latter onely, <hi>Heal the ſick, cleanſe the Lepers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some of the learned think it belongs onely to the latter.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit to covenant for a Reward for ſuch an act, which is directly appointed to the glory of God, is, ſay ſome, doubtleſs contrary to the glory of God: hence it had been unlawfull, directly or indirectly to compact with any man, for any Miracle done for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether is it lawfull for Preachers to take hire? or are they which take any Reward hirelings?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 There may be times when a man may remit of his Right herein, when circumſtances of times and perſons require it. So becauſe of the falſe Teachers the Apoſtle would preach the Goſpel of Chriſt freely at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7, 9, 10. <hi>I preached the Goſpel of God freely, I kept my ſelf from being burdenſome to you, and ſo will I keep my ſelf; that I may cut off occaſion from them that deſire occaſion, that wherein they glory</hi> (which was their preaching freely) <hi>they may be found even as we. Eliſha</hi> in a caſe would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.26. nor <hi>Abraham</hi> would take nothing of the prey which was got from the Enemies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 All agree that to receive gifts for a mans preaching without any compact for the ſame hath no natural filthineſs in it, for ſome things may be honeſtly received which may be diſhoneſtly asked.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> they that took counſel of the Prophets were wont to give them ſome ſmall gifts, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>But, if we go, what ſhall we bring the man? and the
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:171178:376"/>Servant anſwered</hi> Saul, <hi>ſaying, Behold I have the fourth part of a Shekel of Silver,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.9. The man to whom this gift was to be given was <hi>Samuel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides the Prieſts and Levites under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> had large portions out of moſt of the Sacrifices, beſides Tithes they had eight and fourty Cities of Refuge with Suburbs to them, ſo that the Lord ſays, <hi>Which of you would ſhut the doors for nought? or kindle a fire on my Altar for nought? Mal.</hi> 1.10. which Argument the Apoſtle preſſes for maintenance for Miniſters of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9.10.13. where he ſhews that the Levites who took the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the People, and killed them, and pulled off their skin, cut them in pieces and brought them to the Prieſt, and laid the Wood in order, lived thereon. The Prieſts lifted up the Sacrifice, and laid the fleſh on the Altar, and burnt it. The Apoſtle, when he ſays, <hi>They which miniſter about holy things live of the things of the Temple,</hi> means the Levites, and they which wait at the Altar are partakers with the Altar, meaning the Prieſts, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Now, if they were ſo plentifully maintained, ſhall Goſpel Preachers be the onely ſufferers, and that in a time of Light? When the Apoſtle makes this reddition, <hi>Even ſo hath God appointed that they that preach the Goſpel ſhall live of the Goſpel, v.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Maintenance is due to Preachers from natural and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil equity. 1 Natural equity, that as the Souldier that defends the Countrey lives of the Countreys pay, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Who goes to warfare at his own charge?</hi> or as he that plants a Vineyard eats the fruit of it, milks a flock and eats of the milk of it, ſo Preachers muſt live of the People they preach to.</p>

That Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn.</hi> The Apoſtle argues from the leſs, If an Ox were not to be muzzled when he rowled a wooden beam over the Wheat, to ſhake the Corn out of the ear, ſhall maintenance be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:171178:377"/>to thoſe who threſh in the Lords Barn? Nay, it was not written for Oxens ſake but for Preachers ſake, as the Apoſtle expounds it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9. <hi>That he that ploweth ſhould plow in hope, and he that threſheth in hope ſhould be partaker of his hope.</hi> Where we ſee it's lawfull for a Teacher to do Gods work rightly, and yet have an expectation and hope of maintenance for his labour. The hope of the ſuſtentation of his neceſſities, and (if the people be able) conveniences from the people, and the hope of the Reward of his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 From Goſpel ordinance <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Let him that is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to make him that miniſtreth partaker in all good things.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. God hath appointed that <hi>they who preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.7.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Becauſe they have power to forbear working in bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour, hence by divine right maintenance is due, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. <hi>I onely and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>have we not power to forbear work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>I wrought that I might not be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> not that we have not power, but to make our ſelves enſamples. And when the Apoſtle did work with his hands, he calls it an abaſing of himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. and numbers this up among the reſt of his afflictions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The true note of an hireling is to make hire the end of his work, not the taking of hire or wages: when for filthy lucre ſake a Preacher ſhall take the overſight of a people, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.2. <hi>Feed the flock of God, taking the overſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not by conſtraint but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready minde.</hi> Now for the lawfulneſs of taking wages, ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>I robbed other Churches, taking wages of them;</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a ſtipend, ſuch as was given to Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for their military ſervice, ſo taken, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Be content with your wages,</hi> where the ſame word is uſed. And military penſions or ſtipends were ſometimes part meat and part mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:171178:377"/>now <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to rob or ſpoil theſe <hi>Macedonian</hi> Churches, taking wages of them, becauſe he had led them in triumph by the Goſpel, as ſpoils taken in vvar. See <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.7. <hi>The Workman is worthy of his hire,</hi> or reward, the vvord is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; ſo that not the expecting of a reward from a people, nor the taking of it, makes an hireling, but the making of his hire or wages the end of his preaching, ſo that no more pay, no more preach, neither to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor any other. But for lawfull reward promiſed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this doth not make an hireling, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17, 18. The Apoſtle bids, <hi>Count the Elders worthy of double honour,</hi> and gives this reaſon, for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox,</hi> and, <hi>the Labourer is worthy of his reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the gifts of the Spirit and the work of the Miniſtry. If it were granted that to take money for the gifts of the Spirit were the ſin of <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> yet it follows not that it is of the ſame nature to take maintenance for their work, ſith every handicrafts man, and labourer, of what kinde ſoever, is rewarded for his work. Could preaching come as eaſily to them as the power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles came to the Apoſtles, it were ſomething, <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye have received, freely give;</hi> but who knowes not that perſons that diſcharge this duty painfully and faithfully muſt take much pains therein.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Preachers are commanded to give themſelves wholly to this work, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.4. <hi>We will give our ſelves continually to prayer, and to miniſtration of the Word.</hi> 1 Tim. 4.15. <hi>Meditate on theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them.</hi> Now it's good reaſon that a man ſhould be maintained by that which a man gives himſelf wholly unto, unleſs he pleaſe of his own accord to remit of his right, or the people not able.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Were theſe words of <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give,</hi> meant of preaching as well as miracles, all that were to be deduced were, that the things in the Miniſtry are ſo

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſhows what proviſion the Diſciples were to make for their journey. Whereas every man provides for his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney things needful, they ſhould provide nothing for their journey: ſignifying his providential care over them, that the perſons to whom they preached ſhould ſupply them with all neceſſary things.</p>
                  <p>Withall Chriſt meets with an objection; If we muſt take nothing for doing miracles, but as <hi>We have freely received we muſt freely give,</hi> then we muſt make large preparations of all things for our journey; to this Chriſt anſwers, the Lord whoſe meſſage they go upon, will provide them all neceſſary things: which that they may ſee more plainly, he bids them to go out without making any manner of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Chriſt commends unto them a ſpeedineſs, in that within a few days he would have them to go all over <hi>Judea</hi> and return again, therefore he would not have them trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves with luggage, which might hinder and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their journey.</p>
                  <p>There was three ſorts of money, braſs, ſilver, gold; braſs money was firſt in uſe, none of theſe ſhould they provide.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor ſhoes]</hi> Two pair of ſhoes, or (as ſome think) they were forbid ſhoes altogether, and wore Sandals (as <hi>Mark</hi> calls them) which onely covered the ſoles of their feet from ſtones and gravel, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.9. Of theſe Sandals mention is made <hi>Acts</hi> 12.8. <hi>Gird thy ſelf, and binde on thy Sandals;</hi> theſe they wore that they might be ſo much more ready for their journey.</p>

                     <hi>Neither yet ſtaves]</hi> For in journeying ſometimes the ſtaff breaks, ſometimes it ſticks in ſome deep bog. They might carry one, but no more then one. They that have God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, they need no weapons, onely a ſtaff to lean upon. Chriſt hereby ſhews he would have the Apoſtles carry no ſuperfluous thing, and therefore <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, <hi>c.</hi> 6.8. <hi>ſave a ſtaff onely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the workman is worthy of his meat]</hi> Chriſt gives the reaſon why he ſends them out in this manner. Becauſe where-ever they came their hearers would ſupply them with needfull things, which Chriſt argues from the rule of natural right, that the workman is worthy of his meat. God providing you meat and all ſorts of nouriſhment you ſhall take it of thoſe to whom you preach. Not as if this meat were a ſufficient reward for the preſent, or God intended it ſo for time to come (for what is a little meat compared with glad tidings of the Goſpel which Preachers bring) but Chriſt hereby would mightily prevail upon the Jews with his doctrine, whiles his Diſciples vvould receive no money, but barely content themſelves vvith meat.</p>
                  <p>We may ſee alſo vvhat Preachers are. They are Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vvho though they do not vvork vvith their hands, yet they vvork vvith their brains, and if God will not have
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:171178:379"/>the labourers wages tarry all night with us. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.15. and the Lord ſaith, he will be a ſwift witneſs againſt thoſe who oppreſs in this kind, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. Then let not thoſe who detain maintenance from faithful labourers in the Lords work think they ſhall eſcape.</p>
                  <p>That which is here called meat, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.7. is called a Stipend, a Metaphor taken from good ſouldiers who war onely for the defence of their countrey; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they receive a Stipend, not as the reward of their warfare, but that they may get things neceſſary for life, and may continue in their warfare. For if they receive their pay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reward they ſell a great matter, even their lives at a ſmall rate. Now as there are ſome ſoldiers who fight onely for their pay and plunder, not for the preſervation of juſtice and the Common-wealth, ſo ſome preachers, whereas they ſhould onely or principally preach for the ſalvation of ſouls, and not for temporal things, and ſhould receive their maintenance that they may continue in the Lords work, and moderately provide for them and theirs, they prove themſelves very mercinaries, in making their means and in-comes the end of their preaching. Chriſt himſelf did not refuſe maintenance of his hearers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.3. Perſons that are called of God to preach may hence learn not to be too ſollicitous for their living, and that they ſhould not ſo make it their aim how to get mony as how to win ſouls, and that hearers are in equity and conſcience bound to ſuſtain and to maintain preachers, provided they be labourers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 11. <hi>And into whatſoever City or Town ye ſhall enter, enquire who in it is worthy, and there abide till ye go thence.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Inquire who in it is worthy]</hi> That is fearing God, or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly affected, and tarry with him. They were not to turn into any wicked mans houſe or any perſon infamous, leſt by the infamy of ſuch an hoſt their perſons or doctrine
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:171178:379"/>ſhould become infamous, becauſe they were not to tarry long, Chriſt would have them begin there where there was ſome good preparation already wrought.</p>
                  <p>Now by worthy he doth not mean any man deſerving any thing of God, by way of condignity or deſert, but ſuch as were privy to their own unworthineſs, and humbled under the ſight of God for it; theſe the Lord counts wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. For the Apoſtles were ſent as Phyſicians to ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as preachers of righteouſneſs to ſinners if they would repent.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt would not have them at this firſt ſending to preach in Temples and Synagogues, but onely in houſes, becauſe neither the times could yet well bear it, nor were they furniſhed with ſufficient boldneſs, till after Chriſt his reſurrection. Godly men ſhould ſeek to lodge in godly houſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there abide till ye go hence]</hi> Leſt ye be thought to be inconſtant, or given to delicacy, or leaſt you ſhould offend your hoſt where ye turned in at firſt, but chiefly becauſe they were to tarry there but a ſhort time, for had they tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried long they might have proved burthenſome. Beſides hereby they ſhowed their contentedneſs of mind, and that they were more led with the love of God and of ſouls then of their own eaſe, pleaſure or profit. Moreover Chriſt ſhows he would have the publiſhers of his Goſpel maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a comely way, not in a begging way, to be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one week at one houſe, another week at another. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Chriſt here ſtabliſhes the law of Hoſpitality, as towards others, ſo eſpecially towards preachers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.2. Yet muſt we not receive men of corrupt mindes, pretending whatſoever inſpiration from God, 2 Epiſt. <hi>John v.</hi> 10. <hi>If any man bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe.</hi> We may alſo take notice that where perſons are holy their grace will ſhine, ſo that their neighbours can oft times tell who are worthy, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.16. They will be known by their juſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:171178:380"/>and by being free from ſcandalous ſins.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 13. <hi>And, if the houſe be worthy, let your peace come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word Salute comprehends wiſhes and good deſires. Its a Hebrew proverb whereby we wiſh all happineſs unto a houſe or perſon, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.5, 6. <hi>David</hi> ſent ten young men to <hi>Nabal,</hi> and ſaid unto them, <hi>Greet Nabal in my name, and ſay to him that liveth in proſperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thy houſe, and peace be to all that thou haſt.</hi> This peace they offer is miniſterial, proffering reconciliation by Chriſt who is our peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13, 14. Hence their feet ſhould be beautiful, becauſe they preach glad tydings of good things, and through their preaching the peace of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication flows, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But Chriſt when he ſends out the ſeventy to preach, bids them ſalute no man by the way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt means that they ſhould make ſuch ſpeed in delivering the doctrine of ſalvation, that they ſhould not be hindred from it by acts of humanity. The vanity of <hi>Quakiſme</hi> is in this point refuted. Salutations are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt, not onely to brethren, but to others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.47. exemplified by the Apoſtle in every Epiſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. <hi>Paul</hi> coming to <hi>James</hi> his houſe ſaluted the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Mary</hi> ſaluted <hi>Elizabeth, Luk.</hi> 1.40. <hi>Paul</hi> coming to <hi>Ceſarea</hi> ſaluted the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.22. He ſaluted the brethren at <hi>Ptolomais, Act.</hi> 21.7. practiſed by <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> and <hi>Epaphras, Col.</hi> 4.10.12. Proofs herein are but to light a candle to the ſun. The not ſaluting argues rudeneſs, pride, hatred or coldneſs of love. True religion doth not deſtroy good manners, whence is that religion then which deſtroyes principles of morality? but they as is reported, judging that they have a light within them ſufficient to guide them to ſalvation without the help of any outward
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:171178:380"/>light, and that the Scriptures are not the word of God, but a declaration of the conditions of them that ſpeak them forth, let us reaſon with them as heathens, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them in a way of natural reaſon or Philoſophy. For many heathens are not onely in <hi>Judea</hi> but alſo with us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And if the houſe be worthy let your peace come upon it]</hi> That is, if from the ſence of your miſery you receive this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable tender of reconciliation, ſhowing your reſpect to the meſſage by your receiving the meſſenger, the Lord promiſes that what ſuch preachers wiſh ſhall reſt upon that houſe, and therefore Chriſtians muſt not contemn the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of faithful teachers: now they gathered the houſe was worthy, if the maſter thankfully accepted the ſalutation and reſaluted them courteouſly, as <hi>Boaz</hi> did the reapers and they him, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.4. <hi>The Lord be with you,</hi> ſaid <hi>Boaz;</hi> the reapers anſwered, <hi>The Lord bleſſe thee,</hi> and withal if the man of the houſe invited the Apoſtles to lodge at his houſe, but eſpecially they judged the houſe to be worthy, by receiving the tender of reconciliation held forth in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But, if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you]</hi> As in caſe of worthineſs and predeſtination to life, the maſter and his houſhold received the grace of Chriſt, ſo here is the denunciation in caſe of unworthineſs, in caſe the hoſt whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you come refuſe the ſalutation and your good wiſh, it ſhall return to you. The prayers of Godly men if they do not good to them for whom they are wiſht, they redound unto the perſons who wiſh them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.13. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> prayer and humiliation took no effect for his enemies, it returned into his own boſom. In this caſe the Apoſtles were to turn in to ſome other hoſt, who was willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, but yet not to curſe theſe who had rejected them, being meſſengers of peace. Preachers muſt be armed with patience, knowing ſome of their hearers will be docible and ſome not, ſome receive proffers of grace, ſome not.</p>

                  <p>Moreover Preachers by a tender of ſalvation in a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner have a true peace redounding to themſelves in the diſcharge of their duty, which the perſons to whom they tendered ſhould have had, had they been worthy; as <hi>Pothinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> being asked of the Preſident who was the Chriſtians God? anſwered, <hi>If thou wereſt worthy thou ſhouldſt know.

                  <p>Chriſt ſhews whom he judges unworthy, even thoſe who ſhall not receive the Apoſtles nor their doctrine, and to theſe Chriſt bids they ſhould <hi>ſhake off the duſt of their feet:</hi> whether it were City or Family. The <hi>ſhaking off the duſt</hi> ſignified,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That they had nothing common with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of grace, no not the duſt of their feet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That this duſt would, in the Day of Chriſt, witneſs againſt theſe contemners, that tenders of grace were made to them and they would have none of them. <hi>I would have purged thee and thou wouldeſt not be purged, Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Matth</hi> 23.37. and in the Day of Chriſt hereby they ſhould know, <hi>that a Prophet had been in the midſt of them, Ezek.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Naaman</hi> out of reverence would carry away ſome of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> earth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.17. The Apoſtles out of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence would not carry away any of the duſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 By ſhaking off the duſt they declared the fruitleſneſs of that journey which they had taken in declaring the Goſpel unto them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Shaking off duſt declared that they came not for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake to them, ſeeing they would not have ſo much as any of their duſt cleaving to them.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 That this duſt might be a witneſs againſt them, as <hi>Luke</hi> ſets it down, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.11. ſo <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 13.51. who ſhook the duſt of their feet off againſt the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> and came into <hi>Iconium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7 This <hi>ſhaking off duſt</hi> ſignified that the Inhabitants of that place were ſo polluted, that they infected the very earth with their contagion. This was an uſual way of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, becauſe Chriſt ſpeaks of it as of a thing known among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to give ſome outward ſigns of the things they did, as the ſetting up of a ſtone, or a heap of ſtones, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.47. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 24.26.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 To denote that God did deſpiſe ſuch contemners of grace, as a man doth the duſt of his feet. Alſo they ſhewed hereby they were free from their bloud, and that their bloud was upon their own heads.</p>
                  <p>Now they <hi>ſhook off their duſt</hi> by rubbing their ſhoes or ſandals one ſole againſt another, or rubbing them againſt ſome ſtone or wood: it was an alluſion to that, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13 8. when the Prophet being ſent to propheſie againſt <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the Altar of <hi>Beth-el,</hi> was bid to go another way than he came, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe Preachers may be ready to go away haſtily from a people, when they have not means enough, nor reverence enough from them, therefore Chriſt would have Preachers take notice of three ſins before they leave a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 1 Unthankfulneſs, if they will not receive the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Stubbornneſs, if they will not vouchſafe to hear them; for if perſons will hear, we are not haſtily to be gone.</p>

                     <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, It ſhall be more tolerable for the Land of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the Day of Judgment, than for that City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a terrible threatening againſt thoſe who ſhall not receive the Preachers of the Goſpel, nor their meſſage; <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt alleges this example, which by reaſon of the nearneſs to <hi>Judea</hi> was well known unto them. Their puniſhment was more terrible in this life than <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> which were conſumed on a ſudden, but the <hi>Jews</hi> were conſumed by degrees, and their puniſhments have remained long upon them. The Ephah of their puniſhments is ſet upon its own baſe or foundation, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.11. where, for their contempt of Chriſt, they have for theſe ſixteen hundred years been made a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of Gods ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>Specially theſe <hi>Jews</hi> and all other contemners of grace and the Doctrine of Chriſt ſhall be puniſhed at the Day of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>If there be no eſcaping for neglect of this ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> what will befall their contempt, who ſay, <hi>Depart from us, we deſire not the knowledg of thy ways, Job</hi> 21.14. <hi>If they eſcaped not who refuſed him who ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him who ſpeaks from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Heb.</hi> 12.25.</p>
                  <p>Though other ſins ſorely offend the Lord,<note place="margin">3 Reaſons againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of grace.</note> yet contempt of grace doth exceedingly offend him, as being committed 1 Againſt precious mercy. Hence we ſee how ſorely the <hi>Jews</hi> were puniſhed for their ungratefull contempt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.23. who being invited to come to thoſe dainties the King had provided, went one to his Farm, another to his Merchandiſe, and the remnant took his ſervants and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them ſpitefully and ſlew them, whereupon the King ſent out his Armies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſlew thoſe Murderers, and burnt up their City, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. and for their
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:171178:382"/>contempt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were called in in their ſtead, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. See alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16. to <hi>v.</hi> 25. How would a Phyſician be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, if ſending a potion to a ſick man, the ſick man ſhould daſh the Vial againſt the Wall? Would not the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ſay? Let him die and periſh, I will ſend him no more.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon why God ſo ſore puniſhes contemners of grace, is becauſe they ſin againſt greater light. <hi>Sodom</hi> had not thoſe means of grace the Jews had, hence their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment will be the more grievous. He that knew not was beaten with ſtripes, but he that knew and did not, was bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with many ſtripes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47, 48.</p>
                  <p>Now though theſe <hi>Sodomites</hi> were ſorely puniſhed in this life, yet an heavier puniſhment remains for them at the day of judgement, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. compared with <hi>Jude</hi> 7. to which the Evangeliſt primarily hath reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe <hi>Sodomites</hi> had onely the light of nature, and the admonitions of <hi>Lot.</hi> The Jews beſides the light of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had the preachings of the Apoſtles confirmed with ſo many miracles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There were many ſins wrapt up in contempt of grace, unbelief, diſobedience, ſtubbornneſs, inhoſpitableneſs.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo note here there are not onely degrees of ſins, and torments in hell, but that contempt of grace is ſuch a ſin as might have been ſhunn'd, and that it doth not neceſſarily follow, for then it would not aggravate condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as it doth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25. <hi>Becauſe I have called and ye have refuſed, I will laugh at your deſtruction.</hi>

                     <hi>Then for that City]</hi> Not onely a private houſe, but alſo a whole City contemning grace ſhall be puniſhed, not as if a City ſhould be puniſhed for one mans particular contempt, unleſs they connive, juſtifie, defend or ſome vvay partake therein, but to awaken ſecure ſinners, vvho becauſe they have multitudes of companions in ſin think they ſhall go free.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 That they ſhould be brought before Kings and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils for the witneſs of the truth, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. The conſolation is, <hi>That the Spirit would teach them in that hour what they ought to ſpeak, v.</hi> 19, 20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That they ſhould be hated of all men in general, and of their kinred in ſpecial, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. The conſolation is, <hi>They ſhould be ſaved in caſe they hold out unto the end, v.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Perſecution from City, <hi>v.</hi> 23.

Yea many times Princes have themſelves ſate in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Chriſtians, as the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Indeed the Princes and Councils of the world have other pretences for their malice againſt Chriſtians, but the true cauſe is for the ſake of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But if we be brought before Kings and Governours, let it be onely for the ſake of Chriſt; <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as thieves, and murtherers, and buſie-bodies,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 15.</p>

The Council, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13. when they ſaw the boldneſs of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.27, 28, 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51, 52, 53, 54.</p>
                  <p>Now in that Chriſt ſaith it is not you, it is not meant abſolutely but comparatively; not ſo much you as the Spirit of God by you. The help of Angels at ſuch a time to aſſiſt is much, but the aſſiſtance of the Spirit is far more,
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:171178:387"/>without which in ſuch an hour of temptation the beſt parts and abilities would fail. There cannot be a greater aſſiſtant than this Spirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.15. This comparative ſpeech is like that <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I will have mercy not ſacrifice;</hi> that is, not ſo much ſacrifice as mercy. The force of the Argument is, It's not ſo much your cauſe as mine and my Fathers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Spirit and the Spirit of my Father ſhall anſwer for you. As when <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs ſpoke it was not ſo much the Aſs that ſpoke as the Lord in the Aſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.28. ſo it was the Spirit that ſpoke in the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19. and in <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 21. <hi>And the brother ſhall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the childe, and the children ſhall riſe up againſt their parents, and cauſe them to be put to death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's a third evil to which Chriſtians muſt look to be expoſed to, <hi>viz.</hi> as the hatred of all men in general, ſo of their own kinſmen in particular, becauſe the hatred they have againſt you for the cauſe of Chriſt is ſtronger than the bond of natural affection. Hence it breaks in pieces the bond of natural love. Hence as it was in Chriſts kindred, that not onely they would not believe in him, <hi>John</hi> 7.5. but alſo ſaid he was mad, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.21. ſo is it in worldly men, who hate their relations for difference of Religion. Hence <hi>Iſhmael</hi> hated <hi>Iſaak,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> perſecuted <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren ſold him. <hi>Alphonſus Diazius</hi> ſlew his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>John</hi> for the confeſſion of the Goſpel, <hi>Sleydan lib.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>We ſee the like Hiſtory in the Life of <hi>Woodman,</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by his own brother in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould quiet our hearts when we ſee our friends and kindred rage againſt us for conſcience ſake.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould alſo learn us not to be too confident in carnal relations, how near ſoever allied to us, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.5. <hi>Truſt ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy boſom.</hi> He that is falſe
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:171178:388"/>in his duty to God, how can he be expected to be faithfull to friends?</p>
                  <p>Learn alſo in declining times when friends prove falſe to look to God, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.6, 7. <hi>The ſon diſhonoureth his father, and the daughter riſeth up againſt her mother, therefore,</hi> ſaith Micah, <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſalvation.</hi> This unfaithfulneſs was not onely a ſymptome of thoſe bad times, but it hath been the frame of many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hearts ſince.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 22. <hi>And ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Names ſake; but he that ſhall endure unto the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ye ſhall be hated of all men]</hi> That is, of all unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men that receive not Chriſt, whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> noble or baſe, whether kindred or ſtrangers, old and young. Wicked men hate all good men, if not actually, becauſe they know them not, yet habitually they do; if they knew them they would hate them, even for the good in them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 38.20. which hatred proceeds from that enmity put betwixt the Seed of the Woman and the Seed of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. As love ariſes from ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, ſo doth hatred from diſſimilitude. The World cannot hate you, but me it hateth. <hi>John</hi> 7.7. Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I teſtifie the works thereof are evil. The World alſo hates Saints becauſe they are not of the World, <hi>John</hi> 15.19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For my Names ſake]</hi> That is, for a powerfull profeſſion of it. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> raged much, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves, becauſe they heard that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would be worſhipped alone: now they thought it abſurd that they ſhould caſt off all their other gods (continued to them for ſo many ages) for him alone. Not onely Papiſts but carnal Proteſtants rage againſt the godly of the time, if they will witneſs Chriſt in any powerfull manner, and follow the Light of Gods Word further than the times will bear. <hi>I am guilty of ſuch
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:171178:388"/>and ſuch evils,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bradford, but this is not that mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies perſecute in me, but Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it to be forgotten that, becauſe the word of Chriſt in the mouth of Saints urges an union with the hearts of wicked men, hence thoſe who urge herein are hated, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be any ſuch part of the word as expoſeth to ſome preſent croſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it was the manner for Scholers to be called by their Maſters names, as <hi>Ariſtoteleans, Pythagoreans,</hi> ſo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are called from their profeſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26. and for the profeſſion of living by the rules of their Maſters is it that Chriſtians ſuffer, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15. If any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> rejoyced that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But he that ſhall endure unto the end the ſame ſhall be ſaved]</hi> Here is, 1 A duty, 2 A promiſe. The duty is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to the end, to endure all perſecutions, hatreds, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, to the end both of the perſecutions and of life. To obtain the crown, it's not enough once and again to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but to overcome and endure to the end; and this is ſome comfort, that though they be long they will come to an end. How many hardſhips do we ſuffer in hope of eaſe? We ſuffer an hard Apprentiſhip in hope of freedome, we ſuffer a bitter potion in hope of health, let us endure the croſs in hope of the crown. Soldiers endure much hardſhips in hope of victory, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.5. Here are two graces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us, 1 Patience in tribulations. 2 Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſame ſhall be ſaved] Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithfull unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,</hi> Jam: 1.12. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried he ſhall receive the Crown.</hi> Having the Goal in our eye we ſhould put forth all our ſtrength to run. <hi>For the joy ſet before him Chriſt endured the croſs, Heb.</hi> 12.2. he bids us do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

                        </gap> in this City, flee ye into another: for verily, I ſay unto you, ye ſhall not have gone over the Cities of Iſrael till the Son of Man be come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſets down a fourth danger, to wit perſecution.</p>
                  <p>Three things. 1 The danger, perſecution. 2 The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy herein, <hi>viz.</hi> flight. 3 The promiſe of ſupportance, <hi>Ye ſhall not have gone over the Cities of Iſrael till the Son of Man come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But when they perſecute you in this City, flee ye to another]</hi> Some have pretended the unlawfulneſs of flight, when, being tied by the lines of their temporal lots, they would comply to common corruptions rather then leave them; like ſome Lawyers who pretend to have a great zeal of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, when it's onely to advance their own practice, and to gain credit in pleading; as <hi>P. Martyr</hi> in his book of flight to the brethren of <hi>Luca.</hi> Flight is not onely lawfull but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, theſe rules obſerved;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That a man flye with a diſpoſition and purpoſe of heart, rather to die a thouſand deaths then deny the truth, in caſe he ſhould be taken by the adverſary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That we flye with an intent to propagate and ſpread the truth of God in the compaſs of our callings, whither we go: the ſoldier that flies may fight again.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When we ſee ſnares are laid for us to take away our lives. So <hi>Joſeph</hi> fled into Egypt to ſave the life of Chriſt being an infant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.14. ſo <hi>David</hi> oft fled from <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.11, 12. <hi>Eliah</hi> from the ſword of <hi>Jezebel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.3. Chriſt fled from the men of <hi>Nazareth</hi> when they would have caſt him down from the brow of the hill, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.30. ſo <hi>Paul</hi> fled by night out of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour endeavoured to apprehend him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9 25. ſo when the Grecians went about to ſlay him, he went to <hi>Ceſarea</hi> and <hi>Tarſus</hi> to eſcape them, <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That our flight be without ſcandal, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:171178:389"/>1 cowardlineſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. 2 Without raſhneſs. 3 Without treachery, as hirelings do, who when they ſhould give their life for the ſheep, leave them to the wolf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.12, 13. 4 Without offence to the weak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 That we flye with a minde, neither wiſhing death, nor for the ſake of Chriſt fearing it. Hence <hi>Eliah</hi> his paſſion was condemned, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.4. when <hi>Jezebel</hi> perſecuted him, he cries, <hi>Now Lord, take away my life.</hi> If Chriſt may have more glory by our living then by our dying, we muſt not refuſe to live. Though death was more acceptable to <hi>Paul,</hi> and to be with Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 3. compared with <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. yet for the brethrens ſake he deſired to live.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Conſider whether God may be more glorified and the Church more edified by thy ſtaying, or by thy going, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 When all means of flight are cut off, then are we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſuffer, as in the example of <hi>Shadrach, Meſhech,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> who; had they had means of eſcape, it's very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would have taken them.</p>
                  <p>Yet in theſe caſes, 1 When the cauſe of God hath no witneſs beſides himſelf in a place, a man muſt be very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in flying leſt his heart be troubled herein, and Gods hand meet him. See a moſt eminent example, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. It was <hi>Uriah</hi> who thus flying was brought back and kill'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When God puts a ſpirit of valour into the ſoul. When a man is reſolved to ſtand againſt all the fury of enemies, he is not to be condemned; <hi>Paul</hi> knew <hi>that bonds and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did abide him in every City,</hi> yet <hi>he counted not his life dear unto him ſo he might finiſh his courſe with joy, Acts</hi> 20.24.21.13. Such was that example of one <hi>William Gardiner,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Some exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> an Engliſh Merchant in <hi>Portugal,</hi> who in or about the year 1652. when an high Maſs was at the mariage of the King of <hi>Portugals</hi> ſon to the King of <hi>Spains</hi> daughter, while the Maſs was ſolemnizing he in the preſence of the King and
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:171178:390"/>his Nobles, with one hand took the Hoſt out of the Prieſts hand, who conſecrated it, and trod it under his feet, and with the other hand overthrew the Chalice, for the which he was by grace enabled, notwithſtanding he knew that many grievous tortures muſt needs abide ſuch a witneſs, which with unſpeakable cruelty were executed upon him. See his tortures, <hi>Acts and Mon. vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 746.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For verily I ſay unto you, ye ſhall not have gone over the Cities of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>till the Son of Man be come]</hi> Some think that by this coming is meant, not the perſonal preſence of Chriſt, but the pouring out of the Spirit on believers, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1. which was a certain ſign that Chriſt came as a King with fulneſs of power from his Father, and that his Kingdom ſo long expected was come, the ſending of which Spirit was to be a comfort to them againſt all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>John</hi> 14.18. <hi>I will not leave you fatherleſs, I will come to you.</hi> Now the coming of Chriſt here meant was onely the ſending of the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. <hi>Being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promiſe of thee Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this thing which ye now ſee and hear.</hi> So that the ſenſe is, I have told you what evils hang over you, yet do I warn you to ſtand to the teſtimony you have given, and not to be diſcouraged. My coming unto you by the pouring out of my Spirit is at hand, yea before you ſhall make an end of teaching the <hi>Jews</hi> within the bounds of <hi>Paleſtina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others carry it to the ſending of Miniſtry to the end of the World. For my ſelf, I rather carry it to the conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all perſecuted Saints to the end of the world, whereas the Diſciples might be ready to think, if we ſhall be under ſo great hatred and perſecution none will receive us, to this Chriſt anſwers, There will be Cities of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, Inhabitants in Cities (by a Metonymie of the ſubject and a Synecdoche) of <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be converted, who will receive you untill the ſecond coming of Chriſt in judgment, of
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:171178:390"/>which coming mention is made <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.27. for <hi>Gentile</hi> believers are called <hi>Iſrael, Gal.</hi> 6.17. And in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular it is a conſolation to Preachers of the Goſpel, who when caſt out by one people will be received by another. I rather expound this place of the ſecond ſending than of the firſt, becauſe in the firſt ſending the Apoſtles were uſed courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17. and they came rejoycingly, telling Chriſt the Devils were ſubject to them. And no ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips happened to them that we reade of.</p>
                  <p>We may learn three things, 1 That Saints muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for perſecution, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>All godly muſt ſuffer it.</hi> As <hi>he that was born after the fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit,</hi> ſo is it now, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. If the Son of God were perſecuted, <hi>John</hi> 15.20. Saints muſt not look to go free, <hi>John</hi> 15.20. Hence in or about the ſame year Chriſt ſpoke this, there broke out a Perſecution againſt the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1, 2. after the death of <hi>Stephen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 When Gods people ſee themſelves perſecuted in one City they have a call to fly into another City, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.34.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There will be ſome Saints and Cities that will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive perſecuted Saints untill the coming of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Perſecuted but not forſaken,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 24. <hi>The Diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the Servant above his Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 25. <hi>It is enough for the Diſciple that he be as his Maſter, and the Servant as his Lord: if they have called the Maſter of the houſe</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>how much more ſhall they call them of his houſhold?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt brings here a ſecond Reaſon why Chriſtians in general, and Preachers in particular ſhould patiently endure perſecution, becauſe herein it is no otherwiſe with them than was with their Maſter Chriſt, which Chriſt backs with a twofold Reaſon, 1 The Scholar thinks it honourable to
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:171178:391"/>be made equal to his Maſter. 2 Servants refuſe not that condition which their Maſters patiently endure. So that Chriſt reaſons that if he had ſuffered reproaches and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and lookt to ſuffer greater, even the death of the Croſs, then muſt you my Diſciples prepare for the like. It much tends to patience to know the evils that hang over us, which Chriſt hath foretold us, and hath gone before us by example in.</p>
                  <p>All ingenuous Chriſtians are much troubled with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, hereby to be rendered odious, but it is with them no otherwiſe than with Chriſt. It would be counted an abſurd thing to ſee a General of an Army going on foot, and all the private Souldiers riding in Coaches and on horſeback, ſo will it be, to ſee Chriſt the Captain of our ſalvation to lie under the reproaches of glutton, drunkard, deceiver, devil, and in the mean time we his Souldiers to be in honour with the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If they have called the Maſter of the houſe</hi> Beelzebub <hi>how much more ſhall they call them of his houſhold] Beelzebub</hi> was the god of <hi>Ekron,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.3. <hi>Is it not becauſe there is not a god in</hi> Iſrael <hi>that ye go to inquire of</hi> Baal-zebub <hi>the god of Ekron?</hi> See alſo <hi>v.</hi> 6. The learned render it to ſignifie the Lord of a Fly, or having a Fly, becauſe he was worſhipped and called upon againſt a Plague of Flies, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he expelled and deſtroyed thoſe Flies which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Nazianzen</hi> againſt <hi>Julian</hi> witneſſeth that <hi>Beelzebub</hi> was made in faſhion of a Fly. Hence the <hi>Septuagint</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate <hi>Beelzebub deum Muſcam,</hi> the god Fly. Now the <hi>Jews,</hi> partly out of ſcorn, and partly out of abomination, called the Prince of the Devils the god Fly, which name took its riſe in this manner. The ancient <hi>Jews</hi> with great conſent declare, among other Privileges, which God beſtowed on his Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> this was one, that when ſuch a number of ſacrifices was daily ſlaughtered, there was never
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:171178:391"/>any Fly beheld in the Temple, which when <hi>Jupiter</hi> who was moſt famous among the Heathens could not do, but always his Temple did abound with multitudes of Flies,<note place="margin">Grot. in loc.</note> therefore he was called the <hi>Jupiter</hi> of Flies. Now the <hi>Jews,</hi> learning from the Prophets, that the gods of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were Devils, and the Predictions they foretold to be the works of unclean ſpirits, they called the Prince of the Devils by that name, wherewith the Prince of the ſuppoſed gods was called, as we ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24. Now the Phariſees would perſwade the people that the Miracles that Chriſt did were done by the power of the Prince of the Devils, therefore moſt blaſphemouſly they called Chriſt <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> as if he were his Vicar and Deputy.</p>
                  <p>So that Chriſt reaſons, If they have called me the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> much more you of my houſhold. Therefore ſeeing I patiently bear their reproaches. See <hi>John</hi> 8.48, 49. Do you alſo in like manner. Chriſt ſhould not onely be to us a Patern of Holineſs but of Sufferings. We may alſo ſee the near relations betwixt Chriſt and us; he is the Maſter we his Scholars, he is our Lord and we are his Servants, he is the Maſter of the houſe, Believers his houſhold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 26. <hi>Fear them not therefore, for there is nothing covered that ſhall not be revealed, and hid that ſhall not be known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are an anſwer to an Objection in the mindes of the Diſciples, <hi>viz.</hi> we could eaſily contemn the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the wicked, if our innocency did appear unto others; now we lie under ſuſpition, and we have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. To this Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Fear not</hi> their reproaches, your innocency covered over with ſlanders ſhall one day be revealed.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 This is a note of a wicked man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.18. <hi>The tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.</hi> Wicked men, <hi>Jude</hi> 12. are ſaid <hi>to feed themſelves without fear.</hi> When <hi>Jobs</hi> friends would prove him wicked they bring this, <hi>that he caſt off fear, Job</hi> 15.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 God rejects the prayer of ſuch as fear him not, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.24. <hi>Then ſhall they call upon me but I will not anſwer;</hi> why? <hi>for that they did not chuſe the fear of the Lord.</hi> Hence <hi>Nehemiah cap.</hi> 1.11. prays, <hi>That God would hearken to the prayer of thy ſervant and ſervants that deſire to fear thy name;</hi> and contrarily, <hi>he fullfils the deſires of them that fear him, Pſal.</hi> 145.19.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 The kindes, 1 Servile, which is in ſlaves, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> When we ſtand in ſuch an awe of God that upon ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led deliberation we will chuſe affliction rather then iniquity, <hi>Job</hi> 36.21. <hi>a fiery furnace</hi> rather then worſhip a <hi>golden I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17. and withall have an holy jealouſie that in all our carriage and converſation we may not ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, from the apprehenſion, not onely that God is a juſt Judge, but alſo a gracious father, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The cauſes of this fear are two.</p>
                  <pb n="778" facs="tcp:171178:395"/>
                  <p n="1">1 The love of God. Whatſoever we love we fear, leſt any thing ſhould rob us of that which we love. A man loves his goods, hence he fears leſt plunder, ſuretiſhips, ſtorms ſhould take it away. A man loves his life, he fears leſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes take it away. A holy man loves God, hence he fears leſt any ſin ſhould rob him of his God. He that calls God father, endeavours <hi>to ſpend the time of his ſojourning in fear,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The greatneſs of his ſtrength. Why doth a ſubject fear a Prince, or a Dog fear a Lion? Becauſe they know they are far above them in power and ſtrength. We fear not things that are no ſtronger then our ſelves, ſo, why do we fear God? Becauſe of the infinite power and ſtrength God hath above us: hence Iſrael feared <hi>Goliath,</hi> and the Philiſtims <hi>Sampſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 The power of any creature is feared when it can do us good or hurt, <hi>Iſai</hi> 41.23. <hi>Do good, and do evil,</hi> that we may be diſmayed and behold it together. So we fear God becauſe he can do us good and hurt, and no creature without him can do it, for creatures are meer vials through which God empties himſelf. What power is like Gods that is able to caſt ſoul and body into hell, therefore the Text bids us fear him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The degrees of this fear. In ſome men it is more then in others. It was the praiſe of <hi>Hananiah</hi> that he was a faithfull man and feared God above many, <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.2. There may be two men both conſcientiouſly fearfull of ſin, yet one of them may have a greater fear of God then the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Uſe for information. Learn to ſee the neceſſity of Gods fear. See it in ſix particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It's the beſt preſervative againſt ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. <hi>Thy teſtimonies have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> Prov. 16.6. <hi>By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</hi> Prov. 14.16. <hi>A wiſe man feareth and departeth from evil,</hi> Prov. 3.7.

<pb n="779" facs="tcp:171178:395"/>from <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.10. and as it prevents other ſins, ſo in particular it prevents, 1 ſcandalous ſins, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Ought we not to walk in the fear of the Lord, becauſe of the heathen who are round about us?</hi> Hence <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.9. <hi>The fear of the Lord is ſaid to be clean,</hi> from the cleanſing effect which it hath in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As Gods fear prevents ſcandalous ſins, ſo doth it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſecret ſins. <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> durſt not extort of the poor <hi>Jews</hi> as the former governours had don, becauſe of the fear of God. <hi>Job</hi> was of the ſame minde, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1, 2, 3, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Gods fear will make a man faithfull in the calling wherein God hath ſet him: if a Magiſtrate, <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ſpeaks to the Judges he ſends forth, <hi>Thus take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man but for the Lord, wherefore let now the fear of the Lord be upon you,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.5, 6. alſo he ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Thus ſhall ye do in the fear of the Lord faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, ye can never be faithfull in your Magiſtracy without Gods fear, hence this is one, yea a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall qualification in a Magiſtrate, that he be a man fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.18. the Apoſtle propounds this as a remedy againſt eye-ſervice in ſervants, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Servants obey in all things your Maſters, not with eye-ſervice as men-pleaſers, but in ſingleneſs of heart fearing God. David</hi> giving forth the duty of a Prince, ſaith, <hi>he that ruleth over men muſt be juſt ruling in the fear of God.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 God is wont to deal well with ſuch as fear him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1, 20, 21.

                  <p n="4">4 The fear of God is a ſpecial mean to lengthen our days in this world, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.2. <hi>That thou mighteſt fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his ſtatutes, that thy dayes may be prolonged:</hi> now the reaſon why Gods fear lengthens our daies, is, becauſe it makes a man take heed of ſuch ſins as would cut off life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.27. <hi>The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the ſnares of death;</hi> ſee the contrary threatning to wicked men, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.13. <hi>It ſhall not be well with the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his daies which are as a ſhadow:</hi> why? <hi>becauſe he feareth not before God.</hi>

                  <head>Motives to this Godly fear.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 Gods fear is a perpetual duty. Some duties are but for a time and then at an end, but this is perpetual. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.17. <hi>Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.</hi> Yea, <hi>We are to paſs the time of our ſojourning here in fear.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.9. <hi>The fear of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> Hence this duty is practiſed by glorified Saints, who in heaven know evil as well as good, but by the fear of God in them,
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:171178:400"/>their wills are eternally determined to the choice of good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It's a principal duty, lying upon Saints above all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34 11. <hi>Fear the Lord ye his Saints;</hi> for God is wont to puniſh them more ſorely then other men in this world, when they ſin againſt him. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.21. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him not, for he will not pardon your iniquities, Deut.</hi> 32.19. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. As men that have more to loſe then others are affraid to offend Princes, ſo the Saints that have more to loſe then the reſt of the world, ſhould be affraid to offend the King of heaven; they may, in caſe they ſin, loſe Gods face, <hi>Iſai</hi> 50.10. the peace of their conſciences, and be ſmitten with temporal ſtrokes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It's an honourable Character to be a man fearing God. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.12. It's ſaid of <hi>Obadiah, That he feared the Lord from his youth. Job</hi> 1.1. <hi>Job</hi> was a man fearing God and eſchewing evil. <hi>Hananiah, Neh.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Cornelius</hi> feared God, and all his houſe feared God. Yea a woman that feareth the Lord <hi>ſhe ſhall be praiſed,</hi> Prov. 31.30.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The children of God have found much comfort in this grace. <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Let thine ear be attentive to thy ſervants that deſire to fear thy Name.</hi> Yea, when they finde no other grace in their hearts but this grace, yet are they comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſtay their hearts herein, <hi>Iſai</hi> 50, 10. Contrarily they have been much troubled if they have found either a want or a decay of this grace.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Gods fear, as at other times, ſo eſpecially in evil times, is a principal treaſure to good men. <hi>Iſai</hi> 33.6. <hi>The fear of the Lord is his treaſure.</hi> The meaning of the place is, from Gods fear ariſes all proſperity to ſupply us, as out of a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ariſes money to ſupply our needs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Gods fear is the moſt watchfull affection, as being converſant about danger. How often would temptations captivate us, were it not for this in-dwelling grace in Saints? <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. This grace doth as it were ſtand Centry for the ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 His power and juſtice, <hi>Job</hi> 37.23, 24. <hi>He is excellent in power and judgement and plenty of juſtice,</hi> men do therefore fear him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The pitifull affection or diſpoſition God bears to them that fear him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. <hi>As a father pities his children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</hi> Pſal. 147.11. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him:</hi> in what ever Nation ſuch Saints be (God being no reſpecter of perſons) they are accepted of God with a favourable reſpect, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The relations wherein we ſtand ingaged to the Lord;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Of ſervants. If earthly ſervants muſt have a fear of their maſters according to the fleſh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5. ought not we to the Lord? Hence the Lord expoſtulates, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If I be a maſter where is my fear?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Of children. What dutifull child ſtands not in fear of offending his father? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. We gave earthly parents reverence, <hi>ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits and live?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9 Gods fear ſweetens a low condition. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a little with the fear of the Lord then great revenues and trouble therewith;</hi> that is, then great revenues got with a wounded and troubled conſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.16.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Such men as fear God are bleſſed. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man that feareth alwayes.</hi> They are often bleſſed in this world (eſpecially when a delight in Gods law is joyned therewith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the Lord, his ſeed ſhall be mighty upon earth, wealth and riches ſhall be in his houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo in the world to come they are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.19. When the time comes that the dead ſhall be judged there is a reward to be given to all that fear Gods Name both ſmall and great.</p>
                  <p>Come we to the ſecond thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The true fear of God, where it is, eats out the fear of men; we ſee it in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> parents, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, in the Mid-wives, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.19.
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:171178:401"/>in <hi>Shadrach, Meſhech</hi> and <hi>Abednego, Pſal.</hi> 27.1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The third point, is, God is able to deſtroy ſoul and body in hell. This is called <hi>the ſecond death, Rev.</hi> 20.6. called a double deſtruction, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.18. <hi>The bodies of all that are in the graves ſhall come forth.</hi> John 5.28. <hi>They that have done evil to the reſurrection of damnation:</hi> death and grave gives them up, and they are caſt into the lake of fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14, 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether there be material fire in hell?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeems to me there is, or that which is full as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible or more terrible. This fire of hell is often mentioned, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Who ſhall ſay, Thou fool, ſhall be in danger of hell fire, Matth.</hi> 13.40. At the day of judgement the tares are burnt in the fire. Into this fire, offending members are caſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18, 19. To this everlaſting fire the goats are adjudged, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. In this fire thoſe that worſhip the Beaſt are tormented, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10. and the Sodomites at preſent ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire, <hi>Jude</hi> 7. Yea into this fire are caſt every <hi>unfruitfull branch, which brings not forth fruit, he is hewen down at preſent and ſhall be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire</hi> hereafter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10. Yea every man that lives and dies out of Chriſt is caſt into this fire. <hi>John</hi> 15.6. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch that is withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and men gather them and caſt them into the fire and they are burned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for hell fire, it's 1 Unquenchable. <hi>Iſai</hi> 30.33. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is prepared of old, yea for the King it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of brimſtone, doth kindle it.</hi> Mark 9.43, 44, to <hi>v.</hi> 49. It's five times mentioned that <hi>the fire is not quenched,</hi> that we may not look upon it as an idle repetition, but a thing much to be noted by us. In this fire the rich man was tormented, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It's moſt terrible. We reade of terrible fires, as that which came upon <hi>Sodome,</hi> that which came upon the two hundred and fifty, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.35. the fires that deſtroyed
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:171178:401"/>the two fifties and their companies, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 1.10, 12. but no fire terrible as this; if it be a terrible thing to ſee a Martyr to be burnt, how terrible is it, how terrible ſhould it be, to ſee millions of ſouls going into this unquenchable fire?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It's univerſal both in ſoul and body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But if it be material fire, how can it not be quencht, ſeeing that material fire we ſee in a while ſpends it ſelf?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Do we not finde, <hi>Exo.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>that the buſh burned but was not conſumed.</hi> Though all clothes wax old, yet in the wilderneſs, by Gods power, their clothes waxed not old; ſo God can by his power keep the fire of hell unquenchable. See <hi>Iſai</hi> 30.33. Whereas ſome ſay, If there be material fire, how can the ſouls of men be tormented therewith, being that bodily things cannot work upon ſpirits?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is to draw things to the ſcantling of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; beſides we ſee bodily tortures in this life work upon the ſpirits in the ſame bodies, and why not in hell can the power of God make the fire to afflict the ſoul? Beſides till the day of judgement there is a <hi>never dying worm.</hi> At the re-union of ſoul and body, it's no difficulty to conceive how the wicked ſhall be tormented in endleſs fire.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſafe to leave the plain letter of the Scripture to allegorize, and whether the opinion of metaphorical fire in hell hath not been an introduction of that opinion of the Quakers, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no other hell but what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, I leave to your conſideration, and ſo by contraries, no other heaven.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt had ſhown ſundry dangers to which his Diſciples
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:171178:402"/>would be expoſed: the laſt mentioned was, killing of their bodies, to which Chriſt gives conſolations, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 They could not kill their ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That there is a providence that reaches to the ſmalleſt creatures, even to the Sparrowes, much more will it reach to them. If it reach to the hairs of their head, then will it reach to their lives much more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Are not two Sparrowes ſold for a farthing] Luke</hi> 12.6. ſaith, <hi>are not five ſold for two farthings,</hi> as if one were of no price.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And one of them ſhall not fall on the ground]</hi> Epicures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the providence of God; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhuts it up in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo do the wicked, <hi>Job</hi> 22, 13, 14. look upon God as walking in the circuit of heaven, and that he cannot judge through the dark cloud. Some have thought this providence hath been employed about univerſal things, but not about particulars, ſome have thought it hath been employed about men, but not about beaſts, becauſe of that ſaying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Doth God take care of Oxen?</hi> which muſt be underſtood comparatively, for God takes care of man as of one of the creatures next to himſelf, the beaſts are cared for as appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the uſe of man. And that this providence reaches not onely to kindes but to individuals, we ſee in the Text, in that <hi>one of them falls not to the ground without God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall not fall on the ground]</hi> That is, ſhall be ſhot or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. The birds live and flye in the ayr; when they dye any way they fall to the earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Without your father]</hi> That is without the will, decree, providence and appointment of your Father. God hath fore-appointed all men in a certain bound, when they ſhould be born, when they ſhould dye, by what name they ſhould be called, and what office they ſhould uſe, and after we are born he offers thoſe things preſent, that ſo we may uſe them, <hi>Luth. Tom.</hi> 3.268. Chriſt argues from the leſs, <hi>viz.</hi> If God have ſuch care of Sparrowes, how much care will he
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:171178:402"/>have of you? Seeing he is your father, not the father of Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, therefore he will not ſuffer you to be kill'd by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors unleſs it be to reward you with an everlaſting happy crown, &amp; for the good of others, &amp; there's nothing without his preſcience and providence can happen unto you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not you fear the rage of perſecutors. Beſides, you are redeemed with my blood, which Sparrowes are not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The very hairs of your head are all numbred]</hi> You that are not onely common men, but in covenant with me, and ſome of you publiſhers of my truth. A hair is taken for the ſmalleſt thing. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.45. The people told <hi>Saul,</hi> when he would have put <hi>Jonathan</hi> to death, <hi>there ſhall not an hair of his head fall to the ground,</hi> that is, he ſhall not have the leaſt hurt: <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.18. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.34. <hi>Paul</hi> encouraging the paſſengers in fear of death to eat, tells them, <hi>there ſhall not an hair fall from the head of any of them,</hi> that is, not the leaſt perſonal hurt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> There is not onely a general providence in the world, but a ſpecial providence God hath to every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual creature.</p>
                  <p>This providence is, 1 Ordinary, when God governs the world and all things in it according to the order and Laws ſet by him in the creation, without taking advice of any creature. I have oft endeavoured to preſcribe to God certain ways which he ſhould uſe in the government of his Church and other things, I ſaid, ah! Lord, I would have it done in this order, this event, but God did altogether the contrary, from that which I had requeſted, then did I think, but my counſel is not ſtrange from the glory of God, but will conduce much to ſanctifie his name. It's well thought, but doubtleſs God laught at this my wiſedome, and ſaid, Go too, I know thee to be wiſe and learned, but it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my manner that <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Martin</hi> ſhould teach, lead, form, govern me, I am not a paſſive God, but an active. <hi>Luth.

                  <p n="2">2 Extraordinary, when God works againſt or beſides his appointed order, as in dividing the waters of the red Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1 Becauſe all things, yea the moſt contingent things in the world, are ordered by it, as the falling of a tyle, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 21.13. the flying of the head of the ax from the helve, and killing a man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.5. yea the ordering of a lot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The order of things in the world prove it. 1 Natural order, the motions of the heavens, the Sun warms the earth, the ayr moiſtens it, the earth brings forth the graſs, the beaſts feed on it, and man feeds on them. Look on the fowls, God appoints them their reſidence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.17, 18. and ſo doth he for other creatures. Yea, <hi>the fowl knows her appointed time,</hi> and changes her country according to the ſeaſon of the year. That there's a place appointed for the waters <hi>that they may not overflow the earth, Pſal.</hi> 104.7, 8, 9. that there are ſprings of waters in the Valleys to give drink to the beaſts of the field, <hi>v.</hi> 10. that there ſhould be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of light and darkneſs, that the wilde beaſts ſhould get them to their dens on the day time, that man may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his work, that there ſhould be ſuch proviſions made for all the inhabitants of the world, all this proves to us a providence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Politick order. In Courts of Juſtice one Officer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on another, as wheels in a clock, and moves not without the firſt wheel. How many thouſands are provided for in their ſeveral trades one depending upon another? How hath God made the City to depend upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the Country upon the City? how do all creatures move at his command, as ſoldiers at the command of the General?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 From the reaſonable actions God puts into unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. the Piſmire having no guide, over-ſeer, nor ruler, <hi>provideth her meat in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:171178:403"/>Jer.</hi> 8.6, 7. the Stork, Crane, Swallow, know their appointed time. <hi>Who hath put wiſdome in their inward parts? Job</hi> 38.36.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Should God not take care of things below, it's either becauſe he will not, or cannot, or knowes them not, but to affirm any of theſe were blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In his proviſion he makes for all creatures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.15. <hi>The eyes of all wait on thee, and thou giveſt them food in due ſeaſon; thou openeſt thy hand and ſatisfieſt the deſire of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry living thing,</hi> Pſal. 104.28. <hi>That thou giveſt them they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou openeſt thy hand, they are filled with good; v.</hi> 30.

                  <p n="6">6 In ordering the ſins of men for his own glory and good of his Church. The envy of <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren for the advancement of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the preſervation of <hi>Jacobs</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.

God hath a work in men hearts, as in <hi>Abſalom</hi> who refuſed the beſt counſel. Nothing is ſo high that is above his providence, nothing ſo low that is beneath it; nothing ſo large but is bounded by it, nothing ſo little that he overlooks it, nothing ſo confuſed but he can order it, nothing ſo bad but he can draw good out of it, nothing ſo wiſely plotted but he can ſupplant it, nothing ſo unpolitickly carried, but he can give a prevailing power to it: both is to be taken heed of. Be not proud of thy wiſdom and counſels, if they ſucceed not, do not deſpair, becauſe God governs and proſpers the errours of the godly. I have often committed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt raſhneſs and follies, but I did it not with a deſire to hurt, but unwiſely deſiring to counſel faithfully, hence I prayed that God would amend my errour. <hi>Luth. in Gen.</hi> 27.</p>

<pb n="799" facs="tcp:171178:405"/>means habitual denial of Chriſt in the purpoſe of the heart, when a man for the ſaving of his Lands, Liberty or Life, will deny Chriſt or any part of his Truth. Actual denial of Chriſt is dangerous though but in one act, eſpecially when the ſoul hath time to deliberate, and for ſuch a treachery God is wont to fill the ſoul with horrour, that a man would give all the world to be eaſed of it, as in <hi>Spira, &amp;c.</hi> how much more dangerous is habitual denial?</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is denied, 1 Silently, when perſons can hear the Truth ſpoken againſt, his Servants railed on, Idolatry cried up, and they ſit ſtill as if the thing nothing concerned them; againſt this ſee theſe places, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.46. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.19.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The proper end of Chriſts coming or the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels coming is not to ſet men together by the ears (for what a bleſſed Life ſhould we have would every man obey it?) but by accident; ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 2 34. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>for the fall and riſing of many in</hi> Iſrael; ſo he is called <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling and rock of offence,</hi> which is by accident. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Chriſt is ſaid to bring a Sword from the neceſſitated oppoſition and ſeparation Saints have to the worlds pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Chriſt is ſaid to bring a Sword, from the ſlanderous calumnies of the World, becauſe they impute that to Chriſt which their own Luſts are the cauſe of. Now this diviſion ariſes,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From the contrary diſpoſitions in wicked men and godly. Contraries oppoſe one another. The Goſpell calls for Saints to ſhew humility, ſelf denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the world are contrary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Neither ſide can make abatement of their principles; Chriſt and the Goſpel cannot give ground, wicked men will not, hence ariſes contention.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Goſpel of Chriſt offers violence to Satans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:171178:407"/>hence the Devil rages himſelf, and inrages his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments: as the Princes of the world when a Foreign Prince invades their Territories, arms his ſubjects againſt that Prince, ſo doth Satan ſtir up inſtruments againſt the Saints of God and Preachers of his word, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.1, 2, 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.4, 5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.22. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.22.

                  <p n="4">4 Saints count the Goſpel wiſdom, the world counts it fooliſhneſs: if thou art a King, or Prince, or Teacher of Churches, and ſeriouſly embraceſt the word, the world will count thee mad and fooliſh, <hi>Luth. Tom.</hi> 4.140.</p>

                  <p>In a Family or City when all went in one way of prophaneneſs, all were in peace, but if ſome of them by Gods grace ſhall be called home, Oh what a ſtorm doth Satan ſtir up againſt them? Peace is a ſingular bleſſing, yet better there ſhould be thouſands of tumults and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then that either Satan ſhould hold the ſouls of men in peace, or that errour and confuſion ſhould be throughout the Churches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Exhort. 1 Wonder not at the factions and diviſions in Towns, Churches and Families, about matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion Chriſt hath foretold it: as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> perſecuted <hi>Iſaac, Gal.</hi> 4.29. ſo is it now.

                  <p>There's a ſtory of a Father that gave a quiver of arrows to his ſons, and bad them break them, being united in the quiver, but they could not; he bad each of them after to take out a ſingle arrow, and then any one of them could break them: he made the application, that, ſo long as his ſons were united, none could hurt them, but when diſjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſevered one from another, they became a prey to all.

Eliah</hi> anſwered, <hi>I have not troubled Iſrael, but thou and thy fathers houſe, in that ye have forſaken the commandment of the Lord:</hi> as <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid <hi>to Achan, Joſ.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Why haſt thou troubled us? the Lord ſhall trouble thee this day.</hi> The cauſe why the world troubles the Saints, is, <hi>becauſe they witneſs againſt their evil,</hi> John 7.7. <hi>The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, becauſe I teſtifie of it, that the works thereof are evil.</hi> There's no bond ſo ſtrait which the Goſpel will not break in ſunder through the corruption of wicked mens hearts. See it, <hi>Jer:</hi> 12.6. <hi>For even thy brethren and the houſe of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even they have dealt treacherouſly with thee, they have called a multitude after thee, believe them not though they ſpeak fair words unto thee.</hi> One part of the trial of Chriſtians is to be exerciſed with contentions when the Lord calls his
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:171178:409"/>people from the wicked of the world. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. <hi>Come out from among them, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will be your God and ye ſhall be my ſons.</hi> The world thinks this an intolerable wrong to make a departure, the mother is angry with her daughter for it, and the daughter with the mother, yea ſometimes a Church with a member, and caſts him out for this, becauſe he will preſerve his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience pure. Church-communion is an high priviledge, but to ſin againſt conſcience is too high a price for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 36. <hi>And a mans foes ſhall be they of his own houſhold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt had in part ſet forth the variance the Goſpel brings, not of it ſelf, for Chriſt is <hi>the Prince of peace, Eſa.</hi> 9.6. The Goſpel of it ſelf is <hi>the word of reconciliation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. Believers are <hi>the children of peace and follow after it,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. but by accident, in that wicked men will not ſuffer their ſuperſtitions and wickedneſs to be reproved, he comes to cloſe up all, <hi>that a mans enemies ſhall be they of his own houſhould.</hi> The unconverted wife or ſervant will oppoſe the converted husband and maſter, as Chriſt had prepared his Diſciples in the former verſe againſt the enmity of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and neighbours, which words were in part taken out of <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and truſt ye not in any brother, for every brother will utterly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant; and every neighbour will walk with ſlanders.</hi> So now Chriſt prepares his Diſciples againſt all enmity which ſhall be in their own houſes. Some times the childe is angry with his father, becauſe he keeps him in from prophaneneſs, the ſervant is angry with his maſter and will not tarry with him, becauſe he is too ſtrict: how oft doth the husband riſe againſt the wife? for this <hi>Jobs</hi> wife upbraided her husband with the buſineſs of his integrity, <hi>Doſt thou yet retain thine inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity? Michal</hi> ſcoft at <hi>David</hi> for his dancing before the Ark, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 37. <hi>He that loveth father or mother more then me, is
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:171178:410"/>not worthy of me, and he that loveth ſon or daughter more then me, is not worthy of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a conſolation againſt the former evil, to wit, he that ſhall leave relations and friends for Chriſt, Chriſt vvill count ſuch a man vvorthy of him. Chriſt adds theſe vvords <hi>[above me]</hi> leaſt any ſhould think Chriſt to forbid love of parents. Wee may love them but not above Chriſt, if vve doe, Chriſt vvill not think us vvorthy of him, that is, he vvill not account ſuch in the number of his Diſciples. The ſum is, Chriſt vvould have his Diſciples ſuffer all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of extremities rather then to be taken off from faith and obedience to him, and he that vvill not ſuffer this, is not vvorthy of him, that is he is unvvorthy to be called a Chriſtian, neither hath he any part in his Kingdom of grace or glory. Under father and mother he means all relations whatſoever, whether Magiſtrates, Maſters, Husbands, Kinſmen, Friends, and all the good things we have or hope to have from them, as Wealth, Honour, Lands. It might ſeem very ſharp that we muſt make them who are in the ſame ſociety with us Enemies, Chriſt therefore tells us that upon no other terms we can be his Diſciples, therefore we muſt ſee the price of being Chriſts diſciples. The ſum is, Chriſt is to be loved ſovereignly, and every creature ſubordinately; <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. If our love to any creature hinder us from following Chriſt, let us learn <hi>to count it dung for Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Phil</hi> 3.8. When a caſe comes that either God is to be denied or a creature, then is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be denied. The reverence of Parents is to be caſt off if it cannot ſtand with the reverence of God: the will of God being known we muſt not diſpute of <hi>laws</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, but we muſt obey Gods command without any deliberation, becauſe neither the Pope, parents, or <hi>Caeſar</hi> have this title; <hi>I am the Lord thy God. Luth</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.</p>
                  <p>Love is an affection whereby the ſoul is carried out to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſomething it eſteems to be good. There are three things in love.</p>
                  <pb n="809" facs="tcp:171178:410"/>
                  <p n="1">1 Affection, whereby we are inclined to ſome known good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Deſire that we may be united to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Joy, whereby we reſt in that good thing obtained. Theſe three are in every ordinary ſubordinate good.</p>
                  <p>But in the ſupreme good all the appetites and affections of Saints are carried ſoveraignly to him, and with much joy reſt in him.</p>
                  <p>If we love not Chriſt ſoveraignly, we love him onely as a creature, neither is it enough to love the Lord Jeſus better then many things: if there be any thing we love above him or equal with him, whatſoever thing we ſo love we make an Idol. See my treatiſe of the love of Chriſt. To love Chriſt thus, 1 Beware you be not enſnared with the fear of men, or any hardſhips. 2 Nor with favours of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>V.</hi> 38. <hi>And he that taketh not his croſs and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in the former Verſe we were to forgo any thing for God, loving him ſoveraignly, ſo are we required to ſuffer any thing for him, loving him undividedly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that taketh not his croſs]</hi> By croſs he means every af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that lies in the way of duty, whether it be an office which cannot be had with a good conſcience, or the favour of this or that man. Many give a lift at the croſs, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it heavy they let it fall down again. Others think when they have taken up ſome one or few croſſes they have done enough, whereas taking up the croſs is a continual duty. Hence it's put in the preſent tenſe. And <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, it's a duty daily to be done, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. for what week or month is there, but, if a man will be true to his conſcience, he ſhall finde ſome croſs or other lying in his way?</p>
                  <p>Chriſt doth not mean onely crucifying, or the death of the croſs, which every Chriſtian for Chriſt is called to take up, but alſo Chriſt means all other croſſes. This death of cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:171178:411"/>was uſual among the <hi>Romans,</hi> invented by cruelty it ſelf, if <hi>Cicero</hi> may be believed, among whom the word came to be uſed for all kinde of diſprofit or ſuffering, as the Phraſe <hi>abi in malam crucem</hi> denotes, and the Latine word <hi>crucior.</hi> Now theſe words of <hi>taking the croſs</hi> and <hi>taking up the croſs,</hi> mentioned, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. and that of <hi>bearing the croſs, Luk.</hi> 14.27. are the words uſed in the ſuffering of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.32. <hi>Mark</hi> 15.21. where the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is uſed as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.17. to ſhow, that the manner of calling ſufferings by the name of the croſs was taken from that ſuffering upon the croſs.</p>
                  <p>So that to take up the croſs is to have a diſpoſition for all manner of ſufferings for Chriſt, whether priſons, death, or baniſhment. So <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20.24.21.13. So <hi>Peter,</hi> though he went in his own ſtrength, yet the bent of his heart was right, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.31. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.33. <hi>Lord, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to go with thee both into priſon and to death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt calls theſe ſufferings by the ignominious name of the croſs, that Chriſtians may not expect worldly glory and domination, but rather ſcoffs, and mocks, and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyings.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, in that Chriſt ſaith we muſt take up the croſs, it denotes unto us a voluntary obedience, that we neither fret at God or man who hath been any ways inſtrumental in our ſufferings: this ſhould ſomething quiet our mindes, that as Chriſt adjudges all his Diſciples to the croſs, ſo doth he us to our croſſes, and in that Chriſt ſaith <hi>[his croſs]</hi> he means not that we ſhould create croſſes for our ſelves, but only take from the hand of God &amp; bear upon our ſhoulders thoſe which the Lord lays on us. We are ready to think our own croſs heavier then others croſſes, but if all the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the world were laid on an heap, and an equal divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend were made of them, I queſtion whether thy ſhare would not come to more. Some man can bear poverty, but cannot away with infamy or diſgrace. Others will ſuffer
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:171178:411"/>diſgrace but not impriſonment, others impriſonment but not corporal puniſhment, but a Chriſtian that is worthy of Chriſt muſt take up all.</p>

<pb n="817" facs="tcp:171178:414"/>no man worthy of himſelf who followeth him not. To the taking up the croſs we muſt add this, to follow Chriſt. Now to follow Chriſt is to do whatſoever he commands, without exception, whether it be to do or ſuffer, at all times rather then to leave the Lord. When the conſcience hints to us to do ſuch a duty, to witneſs ſuch a truth, to forbear ſuch a gain, to reſtore for ſuch a wrong, to perform ſuch a duty.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here's a ſecond conſolation againſt fear of not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, taken from the Reward that will redound to ſuch as ſhall receive good men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is meant by Prophet?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> One that is enabled to expound the prophetical places of Scriptures. There are three ſorts of Diſciples here mentioned, 1 Apoſtles, <hi>v.</hi> 40. The ſecond ſort are Prophets. 3 Righteous men.</p>
                  <p>In general, by Prophets he means Teachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, theſe are in ſeveral places put next to the Apoſtles. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Ye are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets. Epheſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Which in other ages was not made
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:171178:419"/>known as it is now revealed to his holy Apoſtles and Prophets. Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>He gave ſome to be Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets.</hi> Theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are diſtinguiſhed from righteous men, as a ſort of men abounding in ſpiritual wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. <hi>If any man think himſelf to be a Prophet, or ſpiritual man.</hi> So here in the Text they are diſtinguiſhed from ordinary righteous men by the name, and by the reward.</p>
                  <p>Now for Prophets we finde them in ſeveral of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as at <hi>Rome, Rom.</hi> 12.6. <hi>He that propheſieth, let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie according to the proportion of faith.</hi> At <hi>Antioch</hi> alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1. there was in the Church that was at <hi>Antioch</hi> certain Prophets and Teachers, as <hi>Barnabas, Simeon, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, Manaen, Saul.</hi> In the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there was <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts</hi> 15.32. who being Prophets <hi>exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Acts</hi> 11.27. <hi>the Brethren with many words.</hi> So in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. <hi>gave ſome Prophets.</hi> In the Church at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Deſpiſe not propheſying.</hi> Yea, we finde Prophets in the Church when <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Rejoyce over her, ye holy Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, for God hath avenged you on her;</hi> he means ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets as the Beaſt made to propheſie in ſack-cloath 1260. days, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3.</p>
                  <p>Now of theſe Prophets there were two ſorts in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 Thoſe that did foretell things to come: ſuch was <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, Acts</hi> 11.28. under this kinde came the Propheteſſes. <hi>Philip</hi> had four daughters which were Propheteſſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.9. of this <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. <hi>This is that which was ſpoken by the Prophet</hi> Joel, <hi>ſaying, I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall propheſie; your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams.</hi> And of this it's probable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5, 6. <hi>Every woman praying or

Of which heatheniſh cuſtom <hi>Lucan</hi> in his fifth Book ſpeaks, who lived a little after Chriſts time.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Prophets told things paſt and future to perſons, as Chriſt did to the Woman of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4.29. and <hi>Eliſha</hi> to <hi>Gehezi,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.26. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> 1.6. ſaith himſelf had known and heard many Brethren that could diſcover the hidden things of men, he means ſuch ſecrets as could not be known by the power of mans wit.

                  <p n="2">2 Thoſe that did expound the prophetical places of Scripture, propheſying according to the proportion of
<pb n="827" facs="tcp:171178:420"/>faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. and did apply their doctrines to exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confirmation, ſo <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts</hi> 15.32. to edification and comfort, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3.</p>
                  <p>If any man ask whether propheſying be the ſame with preaching? I anſwer no. 1 The words in Greeek are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now if you ask what theſe Prophets were? I dare not determine them to be Officers in Churches, unleſs I could prove the manner of their call, to make out which, I can finde nothing but that they are put in the order and rank of men who are called by Office, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. As A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers, which is ſomething in order to prove them Officers, but not full proof.</p>
                  <p>Some think them to be grown brethren, ſuch as are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>perfect men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Fathers,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Clemens</hi> makes three ſorts of Chriſtians, 1 They that are turned from the Gentiles. 2 They that are going up towards knowledge. 3 They that are chiefly knowing. It may fall out ſometimes there may be ſome ſuch knowing men in Churches who are by virtue of a gift as able to teach as a perſon in office; pity ſuch gifts ſhould be quenched for want of exerciſe, though I doubt not the fault of the times is on the contrary hand, in that upon pretence of gifted Brethrens propheſying, thoſe that are not gifted in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places are preſt hereto, verifying too much that conceipt that hath been caſt by ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> that ignorance, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and a Concordance were all the accoutrements ſome had for preaching. I ſpeak not this to quench any gift where it is real, but to ſober thoſe who may perhaps think of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more then is meet. Prophets then, if any ſuch be out of office, they are ſuch as are perfect or well-grown Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians

                  <p>I ſhall conclude this with one querie, Whether it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the word of God that a weak Brother that hath but a little meaſure of the Spirit, and ſo conſequently can pray but weakly, and but weak parts, both in the Anali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, Explaining and Dividing the Scriptures, and ſo muſt needs teach much more weakly, be required to be a mouth for the Church at a Church-meeting, eſpecially in a Church where there are Brethren of better parts to be had? And whether the exerciſing ſuch weak Brethren be a mean for them to obtain the gift of propheſie, or whether there be not ſome other way thereto? As taking direction from ſome experienced Preacher, and reading beſides the Scriptures godly books, choſen by the direction of ſome godly Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For which ſtudies, as alſo for the ſtudy of their own heart, they are to ſet time apart, and whether the company of the faithful are to ſet times apart on the Week day, and to meet together on the Lords day, onely to help a weak Brother to increaſe his gifts, or rather to try whether he can by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe increaſe them by our hearing of him, or whether the faithfull (whether Lambs or Sheep) are not to meet, to hear ſuch perſons as are able to feed them with knowledg and underſtanding, and whether the faithfull come not for that very end unto hearing, to obtain ſpiritual nouriſhment in the knowledg of duty, and to obtain quickening from their deadneſs of heart by lively and powerfull notions, and alſo growth by a higher meaſure of knowledg and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then hitherto they have had, and whether ſuch weak Brethren are able to give ſuch information, many whereof are onely babes in Chriſt, many of the hearers being ſtrong?
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:171178:421"/>And whether the beſt means of edifying a Church be not to be followed? And whether eſtabliſhed Teachers in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reſerving the liberty of Prophets and propheſie be not onely more creditable for the honour of the Goſpel, and edifying the ſouls of believers by many degrees, then the having ſuch weak Brethren to exerciſe, who beſides that they cannot carry on the Ordinances, with ſuch honour and comelineſs as is meet in ſo great a work, their words being weak are but in a ſmall degree edifying, and ready ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to flat the ſpirits of the hearers inſtead of quickening of them?</p>

And ſome think in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they that receive comfort, and nouriſh the Martyrs of Chriſt, ſhall receive the ſame Crown with them that ſuffer Martyrdom, ſuch as were companions of thoſe who were made gazing-ſtocks for Chriſt are taken notice of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.33.</p>
                  <p>We may hence ſee how much God eſteems his Prophets, in that he promiſes not onely a reward, but ſuch a reward to them that receive them, as of old he valued Prophets and righteous men, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105.15. <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm;</hi> ſo doth he now, not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid harming them, but commands to do them good with a promiſe of reward.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Juſtification is taken for the infuſion of habitual righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, whereby there is not onely a throwing down of the reign of ſin in the ſoul, but there is alſo a ſetting up of a new frame of grace in the purpoſe and intentions of the heart. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>They that juſtifie many ſhall ſhine as the ſtars,</hi> as <hi>Junius</hi> reads it, <hi>they that turn many to righteouſneſs.</hi> This is nothing elſe but ſanctification, if we take the word in a grammatical ſence of <hi>juſtus</hi> and <hi>facio.</hi> Seldom is the word thus taken, and when it is ſo taken, it doth not alwayes ſignifie an habitual effect in the

                  <p>To conclude, there is an infinite righteouſneſs in Chriſt, of which we are not capable, and there is an inherent perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteouſneſs to qualifie him for a fit Mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. and there is a righteouſneſs of ſatisfaction, this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs conſiſts in forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſuppoſe the death of Chriſt doth comprehend the ſufferings of Chriſt, which were in and about his death, which, in regard of pain and anguiſh and propinquity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his death were as parts of the whole. Such was Chriſts heavineſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.37. his agony and drops of ſweat like blood, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44.</p>
                  <p>For thoſe other ſufferings Chriſt endured in the courſe of his life, as hunger, thirſt, flight, faſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe were not ſatisfactions to Gods juſtice for mans ſin, but onely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of patience.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's dangerous to add any thing, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fixeth the Redemption on the death and ſufferings of Chriſt in and about death. He gave his own ſon the price of redemption for us, the holy for them who had tranſgreſſed the Law, the juſt for the unjuſt; for what other thing could cover our ſins then his righteouſneſs? In whom other can we unjuſt and wicked men be counted juſt, then in the alone Son of God?

                  <p n="3">3 The third cauſe of our juſtification is the formal cauſe, whereby Chriſt his ſatisfaction and merit is imputed to us as our ſin is imputed to him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall receive a righteous mans Reward]</hi> That is, they ſhall not onely receive the examples of thoſe holy men they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and their edifying ſpeeches, uſually holy, either for matter or manner of ſpeaking, and ſometimes their power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayers for them, but they ſhall alſo receive the ſame reward of eternal glory which the righteous man himſelf ſhall receive, for the juſt ſhall live by faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here's a third ground againſt fear of not being received, which the Diſciples and other Chriſtians might expect for the cauſe of Chriſt, to wit, that the ſmalleſt kindneſs done to any of Chriſts little ones ſhall not go without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones a cup of cold water]</hi> That is, being able to give no more, for
<pb n="854" facs="tcp:171178:434"/>if we can give a cup of wine, and ſhall put the matter off with a cup of water, Chriſt will think this but cold enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. The meanneſs of the benefit ſhall not make the kindneſs leſs reſpected with Chriſt: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing minde it is accepted according to that a man hath.</hi> He names cold water, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſuppoſes, leſt any man ſhould excuſe himſelf that he wanted fire, or a veſſel to heat it. By little ones Chriſt means thoſe who are baſe and vile in their own eys from the ſenſe of their Infirmities, and deſpiſed by the proud men of the world. Againſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and deſpiſing theſe little ones Chriſt warns, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.6. 1 Saying, <hi>It were better a man had a Mill-ſtone hanged about his neck and he be caſt into the Sea,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to puniſh ſome Malefactours, than offend ſuch little ones.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Angels of theſe little ones do always behold the face of God, therefore take heed how ye deſpiſe them. God dignifies them with attendance of Angels, therefore do not ye deſpiſe them. If not deſpiſe them then muſt you receive them, and relieve them, even thoſe who are the meaneſt members of his body. Even as <hi>Rebecca</hi> when ſhe entertained <hi>Eleazar, Abrahams</hi> ſervant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.17. and gave him water, obtained a great reward, ſo ſhall thoſe who receive the little ones of Chriſt, and give a cup of water to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the name of a Diſciple]</hi> That is, becauſe he is my Diſciple, and cleaves to my Doctrine, becauſe he believes in me, and belongs to Chriſt, as <hi>Mark</hi> hath it, <hi>cap.</hi> 9.41. This looking at Chriſt in the intention of the giver doth prove the rectitude and luſtre of the action, it nobilitates and commends it, ſo that it's done to Chriſt which is beſtowed on a Chriſtian, and ſo Chriſt interprets it <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40. If you do it upon other account, as becauſe he is your Tenant, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Kinſman, Friend, though it may be an act of natural
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:171178:434"/>mercy, yet doth not Chriſt eſteem it as a kindneſs done to him. In all our hoſpitality in general, and for this in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ought we to eye Chriſt. Learn we then that our deeds are eſteemed of God according to our minde and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, provided the minde of the Intender be enlightened in his duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his Reward]</hi> The world will hardly believe that the meaneſt ſervice done to Chriſt his Diſciples will be acknowledged, according to the intention and ability of the giver, and that ſuch action of ſo ſmall valuation ſhall be rewarded; hence Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it with an Aſſeveration, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his Reward.</hi> Yet ſhall he not have ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward herein as if the ſame were done to a Prophet. God hath rewards affixt to all the ſervices done for him, but to ſome greater than other, yet not by way of merit but of free grace, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. Every man ſhall receive a reward according to his own labour, which reward flows not from any compact or from any commenſuration, but from Gods free grace. Reward doth not always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe Merit as its correlate, but onely labour or ſome preceding action. Sometimes the reward is inferiour to the work, as when a man works hard for a covetous perſon who rewards ſlenderly, ſometimes the reward is as much as the work, this reward preſuppoſeth merit, ſometimes the reward is far greater then the work, as for a Prince for an hours ſervice to give a man 10000 pound a year, ſuch is all our obedience in reſpect of that ſuperabundant weight of glory. Hence this reward is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a free gift, Rom.</hi> 6.23. becauſe all our works, how great ſoever, have no commenſurate or proportionable value being compared with the reward. Hence the reward of glory is called an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which doth not preſuppoſe any deſert. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaying, <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> doth not ſay <hi>eternal life</hi> is the wages of holineſs, but calls it <hi>the gift of God, Rom.</hi> 6.23.</p>

                  <p>Obſerve theſe things, 1 The meaneſt ſervice done to the meaneſt of the ſervants of Chriſt ſhall be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.36. Even Goats hair was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected when brought to the Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is a free gracious reward that God hath in ſtore to diſtribute to them that receive perſons becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Lord in the actions of Chriſtians looks much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſincerity of their actings, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5. <hi>To whom did ye faſt, did ye faſt to me?</hi> God not onely looks upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of a King, as <hi>Hezekiah, Iſai.</hi> 38.3, 5. but alſo of a poor ſervant, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>q. d.</hi> Deceitfull ſervants have a double heart, ſincere ſervants have a ſingle heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1 Becauſe what is done in ſincerity is done to God. <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5. This was <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> end, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. If I might have my wiſh I would chuſe the baſeſt work of a ſervant-maid, before all the victories and triumphs of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Why? Becauſe here is God, there is the devil; the matter of the work is the ſame, but the kinde and difference infinitely diverſe. <hi>Luth. in Gen.</hi> 29. He means it of works done in ſincerity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe ſincere perſons in what they do, endeavour to approve themſelves to Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>We are not of them who huxter the word of God, but as of ſincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.2. <hi>commending our ſelves to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God.</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4. <hi>So we ſpeak, not as pleaſing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3 That ſo he may either condemn or crown the action; condemn it, if it ſhall onely have a pretence, as in <hi>Jehu</hi>'s deſtruction of <hi>Baal,</hi> who did it not out of hatred of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but to get a Kingdome, See <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4 Hence <hi>Jehu</hi> is charged with murther. <hi>I will avenge the bloud of Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu,</hi> or crown it when it is done in ſincerity, as in <hi>Cornelius</hi> prayers and alms, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.2.</p>

Think not any thing well done wherein thou canſt not appeal to God in the doing thereof: when we come to die thoſe things will comfort us moſt wherin we have had moſt reſpect to God and leaſt to men. It's not the greatneſs of ſervices we do, but the truth that God accepts, where there is ſincerity, though there may be diverſe fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, God knows how to overlook them. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20. and <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.15.</p>

Becauſe they did not do it out of love to holineſs, to keep the memory of holy men alive, but to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their malice againſt Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Sincerity differences the actions of one man from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p n="3">3 The conſcience is not ſatisfied in any ſervices ſave thoſe which are done in ſincerity.

                  <p n="5">5 There ſhall be a general diſcovery of the ſecrets of all hearts, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. take heed of hypocriſie, why? <hi>For there is nothing covered that ſhall not be revealed, nor hid that ſhall not be known.</hi> The very counſels of the hearts <hi>ſhall be opened.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.14.</p>

The widow had more comfort in giving her two mites then all they that had given large gifts. One ſhilling given ſincerely is more comfortable then pounds given vain-gloriouſly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75. Eſpecially this comforts in an evil time, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4, 7, 8. In that time conſcience will not ſo much ask what you have done, as to whom you have done it. In that day thoſe things wherein we have had moſt reſpect unto God and leaſt unto men will bring moſt comfort. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had done much for God, but his chief comfort was not, the things done, as the manner of doing them. Many have received righteous men, but they will have comfort that have received righteous men as ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Sincerity gives a luſtre and beauty to the ſervices we do, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are ſaid to be righteous before God. <hi>Paul</hi> praiſes the graces of the Theſſalonians that they were <hi>in the ſight of God and our father,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is commended that <hi>he turned his face to the wall and wept, Iſai</hi> 38.2.

Thoſe that kill'd the Apoſtles thought they did God ſervice in it, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. The <hi>Jews</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Chriſts righteouſneſs had the zeal of God in it, that is, they lookt at God in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. But ſincere perſons have a deſire to, and purpoſe for to ſet God ever before them, yea if any by-ends come in they are troubled at it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From whom do you expect a reward? hence a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Preacher preacheth with all his ſtrength though people be not gathered, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 49.4, 5.

Hypocrites will do good where there are many eyes to behold them, <hi>Matth,</hi> 6.2. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.5. but very ſeldom do they any good in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; but ſincere ſouls do good in ſecret. Their alms, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and faſting, they ſtrive that it may be in ſecret. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So on the other ſide they avoid evil in ſecret. <hi>Joſeph</hi> durſt not come near his Miſtreſs, though none but he and ſhe were in the houſe. <hi>Job</hi> durſt not lift up his hand againſt the fatherleſs, <hi>though he ſaw his help in the gate, Job</hi> 31.21. He eſchews helliſh thoughts, and groans under them, crying, <hi>Cleanſe me, Lord, from ſecret ſins then ſhall I be upright, Pſalm</hi> 19.12, 13. Contrarily hypocrites and wicked men will venture to do evil in ſecret; all their care is to cover it from the eye of man. Hence they ſtick not to plot miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in ſecret. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 64.2, 4. They will ſlander in ſecret,
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:171178:439"/>
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.24. <hi>Moſes</hi> calls it <hi>a ſmiting their neghbour ſecretly.</hi> They do ſecretly accept perſons, <hi>Job</hi> 13.10. In a word, <hi>its a ſhame to ſpeak of the things that are done of them in ſecret. Eph.</hi> 5.12. Yet may they refrain from open and ſcandalous ſins, and live and dye without any ſuch, though uſually God leaves them to fall into ſome open ſin, that ſo <hi>their name may rot. Prov.</hi> 10.7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The ſingling out God from all other objects, that come what will come they will not leave the Lord. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould rejoyce in any thing, ſave in the croſs of Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 8.35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> He means both active and paſſive love, which the Lord hath to us and we to the Lord. Hypocrites on the other ſide are double minded, their hearts are divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and ſome luſt. <hi>James</hi> 1.8. <hi>A double minded man is unſtable in all his wayes.</hi> Sometimes they are for God, ſometimes for the world, hence where any ſoul ſincerely turns to God, <hi>he purifies himſelf from double mindedneſs.

                  <p n="5">5 Senſibleneſs of, and groaning under inward diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 23. Troubled under hardneſs of heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. Unbelief, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.23. Privy pride, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8. From a principle of tenderneſs of conſcience they have received and a bleſſed light God hath ſet up in their hearts they are ſenſible of ſuch evils as the world counts nothing, yea they are more troubled for theſe then wicked men are for groſſe evils; they complain of themſelves for not ſtriving with God to keep off his judgements, for their cloſe hypocryſie, heavineſs in the ſervice of God, dulneſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. <hi>There's none that ſtirs up himſelf to take hold of thee,</hi> A ſincere ſoul, though he do duties outwardly plauſible, yet is he not contented unleſs he finde his heart doing of them as well as his outward man; ſo though his outward carriage be blameleſs, yet is he not ſatiſfied, if there be diſtempers of pride, revenge, earthlineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within, till
<pb n="865" facs="tcp:171178:439"/>he have in ſome good meaſure pray'd down theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.12. ſaying, <hi>Cleanſe me Lord from my ſecret ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Contrary unſound men make clean the outſide of the cup and platter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.25. But the inſide is full of rapine and exceſs. Their chief care is to have a ſmooth carriage to the world.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Sincerity is moved by a command. Other men are moved by credit, profit, but ſincere men, might they have never ſo much credit or profit, yet having a contrary known command, they will not move; contrary, where they have a plain command, though they have no ſecondary motives of favour, credit, profit, yet are they moved to act thereby, as we ſee in Queen <hi>Heſters</hi> caſe, who went unto the King. <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 11.8. Compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. Yea though to tell a Prince of Gods wrath, as <hi>Micaiah</hi> to <hi>Ahab, John Baptiſt</hi> to <hi>Herod, Gad</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore foraſmuch as Saints, out of the ſight of their indwelling corruption, are ready to condemn themſelves, and ſo walk heavily, and Satan labours if he cannot take their uprightneſs from them, yet to take the comfort of it from them, they may, by theſe and ſuch like ſigns, know their uprighneſs which faithfull Preachers are to declare unto them.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed far more dangerous to hope without a cauſe then to fear without a cauſe, yet when an upright ſoul counts it ſelf not upright, there are many inconveniences thereby; as he can neither rejoyce in living, nor think comfortably of dying, he is backward to prayer, he can hardly give thanks for any thing, becauſe he knows not but God may be his enemy in time to come, and may damn him, he cannot long for the coming of Chriſt, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himſelf in the contemplation of the good things laid up in heaven, hence though theſe fears may be let in by God to beat down our pride, yet are they apt to hinder us in our courſe.</p>
                  <pb n="866" facs="tcp:171178:440"/>
                  <p n="7">7 When a man hath an open heart to receive every truth of God, though ſuch a truth may prove prejudicial to his outward advantage. When any truth of God whiſpers to an unſound man ſomething that may be contrary to his temporal being, or may bring him to hazard, he doth as <hi>Herod</hi> did with the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> firſt puts it in Priſon and after kills it. Contrarily, ſincere men are like <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10.33. <hi>We are here to hear all things that are commanded us from God,</hi> ſo far as they can be convinced herein.</p>
                  <p>But unſound men apprehending the truth will part them from ſome luſts they are not willing to leave, that it will be a bar to advantage, and a companion of perſecution, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch times and places, that it will loſe them friends and procure them enemies. <hi>They ſay to the Seers, See not, and to the Prophets, Propheſie not, Iſai</hi> 30.9, 10. Though they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſaid not ſo in words, they ſaid ſo in their carriage. Unſound men keep at a diſtance from truth, as Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers do from perſons whom they ſuſpect comes to rob them.</p>

Thou art no better than an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite till thou findeſt that every Truth thou readeſt or heareſt in the Word hath an authority and power over thy will, let the command be for doing or ſuffering, yet art thou not ſincere but ſhalt one day be aſhamed, if thou haſt not reſpect thereto, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24. In ſomething or other the Hypocrite diſcovers himſelf, if not to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of others, yet to the conviction of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The Prophet proves himſelf upright that he did not ſpare his ſin, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18.23. which he was moſt inclined to. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.3. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 1. Upright men they do no iniquity, that is, not wittingly and knowingly. <hi>Iſai</hi> 56.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.18. To do ſome good things, the Maſter requires doth not argue a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 A ſincere man makes conſcience of ſmall ſins. No
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:171178:440"/>Hypocrite almoſt but makes conſcience of groſs and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious evils, but they hate preciſeneſs in ſmaller matters. They count ſuch preciſeneſs hypocriſie, which indeed is ſo, if it be in things not commanded of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.5, 6. or if it be commanded of God, we ſhall make more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them than we do of the weightier points of the Law. When a man makes conſcience onely of the great things of the Law, it may be a queſtion whether conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God or credit to men be a mover herein. Hence ſincere men ſet themſelves not onely againſt Murder, but alſo cauſleſs anger, not onely againſt Adultery of body, but againſt <hi>looking upon a woman to luſt after her.</hi> The ſons of <hi>Jehonadab</hi> did not onely refrain drunkenneſs, but alſo taſting of Wine, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35.6. not onely they forbear falſe witneſs in a Court of Juſtice, but alſo jeaſting Lyes: he keeps himſelf not onely from thieving, but from deceiving a penny or two.

                  <p>Hypocrites may ſometimes ſtand for Juſtice, and be a while importunate for it, yet be overcome, as that King that would fain have delivered <hi>Daniel</hi> and ſtood for him to the going down of the Sun, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.14, 16. and <hi>Pilate</hi> would fain have delivered Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 19.12. but when he ſaw, if he ſtood any further for him that he muſt be counted an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then he delivered up Chriſt.

                  <p n="2">2 Subordinate and conditional. Hypocrites make God their ſubordinate and conditional end, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.5. <hi>Your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that hated you, that caſt you out for my names ſake, ſaid,
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:171178:441"/>Let the Lord be glorified.</hi> They lookt at Gods glory in caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Saints. So <hi>Jehu</hi> he had a zeal for the Lord of hoſts, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16. but the Lord was not his laſt end, but his laſt end was to get a Kingdom, to which all other ends were ſubſervient.</p>
                  <p>Contrarily, a ſincere man makes God his laſt end; as he ſtudies, prays, preaches, labours, but why? ſurely in order to God and his glory. God is the end of his ends, his laſt end whereto all his ſubordinate ends refer, that is, an abſolute end, which, if all other ends were laid aſide, moves a man to do a thing. The end a godly man aims at, is to be acquainted with his duty, and to diſcharge it in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, all his projects and endeavours are running heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Slothfulneſs, careleſneſs and remiſneſs in the things of God, and vehemence, eagerneſs and intentneſs in our own affairs, argues that the World is our abſolute and laſt end, and that God is onely the ſubordinate and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our end.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Caution.</hi> If the principal thing that Chriſt looks at in the actions of Chriſtians be the ſincerity of their actings, then let us take heed of hypocriſie in all our ſervices.</p>
                  <p>This is twofold,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Groſs hypocriſie, which is, when a man knows he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles with God or man. <hi>Abſalom</hi> pretended a vow at <hi>Hebron,</hi> but intended the Murder of <hi>Amnon.</hi> Such was <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel</hi> in her pretended Faſt for <hi>Naboth</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Jezreel. Jezebel</hi> knew that ſhe proclaimed the Faſt onely to get <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, and the Elders did it for fear they ſhould provoke <hi>Jezebel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such was <hi>Judas</hi> in his pretending the poor, when he would have had the Ointment ſold, <hi>John</hi> 12.6. and in his ſaying, <hi>Hail Maſter,</hi> and kiſſing Chriſt. So the Scribes and Phariſees in their praying in the corners of the ſtreets, ſo the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.15. in their <hi>making long prayers and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Widows houſes;</hi> they were like <hi>whited Sepulchres, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:171178:442"/>outwardly beautifull, but within full of hypocriſie and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, v.</hi> 27, 28. theſe are like thoſe who at Stage Plays wear a Vizard, they have <hi>Eliahs</hi> Mantle but not his Spirit. They know they diſſemble with God and the World, and if they had the ends they aim at, then farewell God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Theſe perſons who for length of time go on thus are ſeldom converted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Cloſe hypocriſie, which is when a man thinks his actions are good, and words and actions ſincere, mean time the rot tenneſs of his heart is known to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. There is a generation pure in their own eys, and yet is not waſhed from their filthineſs. Such was <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.3. the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Judaiſm, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. the Jews that went about to ſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, yea many Papiſts and formal Proteſtants and Profeſſors. The miſchief of this cloſe hypocriſie is, that it makes way for groſs hypocriſie, as in <hi>Saul</hi> who firſt forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Gods worſhip, after groſly diſſembled. <hi>Judas</hi> firſt clave to Chriſt for gain, after betrayed him with a kiſs. Such cloſe hypocrites were the <hi>Laodiceans. Rev.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this I ſhall lay down four things, 1 What it is. 2 Cautions. 3 What ſignes of it. 4 What reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What it is. There are many deſcriptions given of it; ſome thus, It's when a man will do ſomething in Gods worſhip, but will not do it thorowly; for example, a man is not willing to let the duty go altogether, for then were he prophane, nor will perform it zealouſly, for then were he holy, but when he goes betwixt both, does ſomething but will not do it thorowly.</p>
                  <p>Others thus. Hypocriſie is when a man doth works like unto good works, but are not, either becauſe not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, or becauſe not done as he commands, being done without faith and love, for to deceive others for praiſe or profit ſake. <hi>Polanus l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 643.</p>
                  <pb n="871" facs="tcp:171178:442"/>
                  <p>Others, It's a corruption of the will,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Wheatly,</hi> Gods Husb. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> whereby it inclines it ſelf to ſeem good by doing ſome good and leaving ſome evil for ones own ſake.</p>
                  <p>For the word Hypocrite, ſome derive it of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>under,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifies judgement, becauſe an Hypocite hides his judgement, whiles his outward man goes one way, his minde another; his tongue ſpeaks one thing, his heart another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Budaeus</hi> derives it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from <hi>counterfeiting,</hi> ſo it ſignifies one that takes on him the perſon of another, as Players do, who on the ſtage appear ſometimes as Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, ſometimes as Kings. Tranſlators and Interpreters, fearing the name Stage-players would not be acceptable to godly ears, retained the Greek word Hypocrite, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.5. When ye give alms pray, be not like theſe Stage-players. At the ſecond hand it ſignifies all others which carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with other faces then their own, as Stage players do, feigning honeſty and godlineſs in ſhew, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wicked. <hi>Herod</hi> is an image of the great men of the world, who ſeem to favour the word, but privily laugh at it and deſtroy it, yet ſo that they would not ſeem to have deſtroyed it, yea they praiſe <hi>John,</hi> and love Chriſt. <hi>Luth. Tom.</hi> 4.345.</p>
                  <p>Hypocriſie is an outward ſhew of goodneſs not in the ſoul,<note place="margin">What Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie is.</note> which a perſon knowingly or overweeningly takes upon himſelf for ſome baſe and ſiniſter end, that he may ſeem good to others, or to himſelf, mean time harbouring ſome darling ſin that he will not forſake, and ſhunning ſome duty he will not cloſe with.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 This takes in both groſs and cloſe hypocriſie; groſs hypocriſie, whiles a man ſhall make, 1 an outward ſhew of goodneſs not in the ſoul, as <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Come ſee my zeal for God:</hi> his zeal was primarily to ſecure a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, at the ſecond hand or by accident for God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When a perſon ſhall knowingly take up ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="872" facs="tcp:171178:443"/>contrary to what he knows is in his intent, as <hi>Iſhmael, Jer.</hi> 41.6. <hi>Judas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 To do this for baſe and ſiniſter ends, as the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.29. they builded Prophets tombs to cover malice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 He harbours ſome darling ſin, and will not cloſe with ſome duty. <hi>Sauls</hi> covetous heart was loth to deſtroy ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things as he could turn to his own gain, ſo many oxen and ſheep. So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> confeſt their ſin, yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not let the people go, and <hi>Balaam</hi> would ſtill have curſed the people, if God would have let him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The end of his ſhew of goodneſs is, that he may ſeem good to others, that ſo his wickedneſs may not be eſpied, as <hi>Ananias, Sapphira, Herod, Mar.</hi> 6.20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This takes in cloſe hypocriſie, which hath theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
<list>
                        <item>1 That he doth out of an overweening conceit take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf a ſhew of goodneſs; ſo the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12, 13. he thought he was in a good condition, becauſe he did ſome good things; ſo do many looking upon their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, morality, formality, comparing themſelves with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or themſelves at preſent with themſelves formerly.</item>
                        <item>2 The end of cloſe hypocriſie is, that a man may ſeem good to himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. <hi>There is a generation pure in their own eys, and yet are not waſhed from their filthineſs.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> in his Phariſaical eſtate. See <hi>Acts</hi> 26.11.</item>
                        <item>3 The cloſe hypocrite harbours ſome ſecret ſin. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> were full of unbelief leſt they ſhould come to want, hence they kept back part of the price. The moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined hypocrite in the world lives in ſome ſin.</item>
                        <item>4 There is ſome duty the cloſe hypocrite will not cloſe with, as to let go his eſtate for Chriſt. The young man for all his forwardneſs ſtartled at this, and left Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20, 21, 22. In this ſin of cloſe hypocriſie, many forward
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:171178:443"/>Profeſſors live, becauſe there is ſome duty they will not cloſe with. There is ſome croſs, which becauſe of the weight of it, they will not take up for Chriſt.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many a groſs hypocrite is alſo full of this cloſe hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Yea I have performed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Lord,</hi> alſo <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Yea I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and gone the way which the Lord hath ſent me.</hi> See how <hi>Saul,</hi> though a groſs hypocrite, cloſely would bear himſelf in hand of his good eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Now before I come to give trials of hypocriſie, I will lay down ſome cautions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That even Gods children have but too much hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in them;
<list>
                        <item>1 But, they feel it, bewail it, mourn and groan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it to the Lord, and make a continual reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. They cry out, as <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in another caſe, <hi>why doſt thou not put an end to this filthineſs?</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2 They preſs daily towards, and hunger after more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, ſo come under a promiſe of bleſſedneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6.</item>
                        <item>3 They are enabled by the grace of God to do their actions with more and more ſincerity. The Diſciples were firſt asking, <hi>Who ſhould be greateſt?</hi> After they become ſo ſincere as to refer the matter wholly to God. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.26. <hi>Lord, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Virtues and vices do not denominate their ſubject, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be therein in ſo high a degree as to prevail. As we ſay it's light, when the light is more then the darkneſs, we ſay a thing is white when it partakes more of whiteneſs then of any other colour, though it come ſhort of perfect whiteneſs. So he is a hypocrite in whom hypocriſie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, as it doth in thoſe who do not lament and bewail it. He is ſincere whoſe purpoſe is to be ſincere, and uſually looks at God: no condemnation to ſuch, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Becauſe he walks after the ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="874" facs="tcp:171178:444"/>
                  <p n="3">3 That becauſe of the remainder of hypocriſie in them even Gods children in time of temptation are apt to count themſelves hypocrites.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe they do not feel their righteouſneſs of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as they do their corruption, whereas that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being in Chriſt and corruption in our ſelves, we muſt not think to have a ſenſitive righteouſneſs, as to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we have a ſenſitive corruption.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe, when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the fruits of the fleſh he ſaith they are manifeſt, but he doth not ſay ſo of the fruits of the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. Yea grace is called the hidden man of the heart, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Their little fruitfulneſs: this ſhould humble not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The mixture of by reſpects with duty to God, but this may comfort, that duty ſet thee on work and moved thee to do what thou didſt, though by-ends came crowding in.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Thy feeling thy hypocriſie to be a burthen argues thou art no hypocrite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.80.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Sincerity may ſtand with many evils, though not with the allowing of any.</p>
                  <p>When we lament it, be we not diſcouraged. If thou art not fruitfull in a hundred fold yet be in thirty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 A man may be an hypocrite, and yet have many good things in him, as, 1 to God, he may read, hear, pray, come to ordinances. See <hi>Eſa.</hi> 58.2. <hi>&amp;c. Herod</hi> did many things, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. He feared <hi>John</hi> becauſe he was a juſt man, and an holy, and heard him gladly, and obſerved him, and did many things, yea he may write ſermons, and repeat them and ſhew countenance to the Preachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 As to men he may deal juſtly, be a good neighbour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.20. And as to himſelf he may <hi>eſcape the pollutions of the world,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <pb n="875" facs="tcp:171178:444"/>
                  <p n="5">5 Many Saints have been, and are jealous of themſelves, leaſt they ſhould be hypocrites, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.24. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me. Pſalm</hi> 119.80.</p>
                  <p>Contrary ſome hypocrites are confident of their good eſtate, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.4, 5. They call'd God father, yet did evil as they could, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.4, 5. Hypocrites call God to witneſs that they would do whatſoever God commanded by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and ſo conſequently, could not but think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſincere, whereas they did the clean contrary to what they profeſſed. <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 After examination of thy eſtate, be not alwaies queſtioning whether thou be ſincere, or a hypocrite, but be not too haſty in determining of either, but when thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hath given judgement of the truth of thy heart after ſeveral examinations thereof, hold faſt this concluſion, that though thou haſt many failings, yet thou art not an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite. So <hi>Job. c.</hi> 27.5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Though it be very difficult to diſtinguiſh betwixt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and hypocriſie, becauſe of the many counterfiets that look like grace but are not, as the common graces in hypocrites, yet is it poſſible to diſtinguiſh the one from the other, elſe would not the word bid us <hi>to prove our own works, Gal.</hi> 6.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. Yea ſundry Saints have found their hearts upright. <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 101.2. <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have myſelf in a perfect way, I will walk in mine houſe with a perfect heart.</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Paul</hi> and other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>In ſimplicity and Godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 We muſt not from any obſervation of hypocriſie in our hearts deny any true work of grace in our ſelves, and ſo bear falſe witneſs againſt our ſelves, to cauſe us to walk heavily. The beholding of any truth of heart in our ſelves ſhould make us go on with joyfulneſs, chearfulneſs &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, being ſure God will perfect the good work he hath

If there be no obſervation of man, his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours flag, ſo his care is to keep his naughtineſs from man, but makes little conſcience of ſinning in ſecret. Many will ſay, Have we not writ many books? preached many ſermons? built Hoſpitals? but the Lord will ſay, Thou didſt ſo, but it was to thy praiſe and credit, not out of love to me, nor zeal of my glory.</p>
                  <p>Contrary, ſincere ſouls in what they do, deſire to ſeek the glory of God, not their own glory, <hi>John</hi> 7.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</p>

Though Gods Saints too oft perform dead and liveleſs duties by fits, yet the deadneſs of hypocrites differs in two particulars;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The hypocrite hath a voluntary careleſs admiſſion of rovings in duty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.14. <hi>I was almoſt in all evil in the midſt of the congregation and Aſſemblies.</hi> So <hi>Ezekiels</hi> hearers, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. When they were at hearing <hi>their hearts ran after their covetouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The hypocrite ſees not the face of God in duty, <hi>Job.</hi> 13.16. <hi>He onely is my ſalvation,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job:</hi> how proves he that? Why, <hi>becauſe a hypocrite ſhall not come before him. Job</hi> means into his ſpecial preſence, for into his omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence all creatures come, yea the devils: the dwelling in and enjoying of Gods ſpecial preſence is determined to the upright, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 140.13. See alſo <hi>Pſalm</hi> 11.7. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance doth behold the upright, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light

                  <p n="3">3 Note, Though a hypocrite hath many good things in him, yet the bent of his heart is not for God, he doth ſundry good acts, but he hath no good habit or inclination. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.16. <hi>They return, but not to the moſt high, they are like a deceitfull bow. q. d.</hi> as an archer when he ſhoots, though he aim never ſo well at the white, yet the bow being deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he cannot come near it, ſo theſe hypocrites who howl upon their beds, they pretend to return, but it is not in the purpoſe of their hearts, it is not to the moſt High. Their prayers for corn and wine are onely as the cryes of a hog when he is pinched, or the howling of a wolf when he is hungry; yea even a hypocrite when he moſt forbears ſin, the bent of his heart is for it. See it in <hi>Balaam,</hi> when for fear he ſhould be deſtroyed, he durſt not curſe, yet how did he thirſt after it? how did he love the wages of unrighteouſneſs? and ſee whether God that would not let him curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> at one time, would let him curſe them at another. <hi>Herod</hi> when he heard <hi>John</hi> gladly, yet the bent of his heart was for <hi>Herodias.</hi> All the while <hi>Demas</hi> was with <hi>Paul,</hi> yet the bent of his heart was for the world. As the bent of the dogs appetite is after the porrige pot or drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping pan, though he ſtand quietly by it, or the bent of the wolves appetite is after the ſheep, though for fear of the ſhepheards ſtaff he dare not touch them, ſo the bent of a hypocrites heart is to ſome ſin which he will not leave, though by ſome reſpects he may be reſtrained from it, ſo that habitually he doth the evil which actually he forbears. This is called an inclining to wickedneſs in the heart, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 66.18. A committing ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. a working of iniquity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23. Contrarily the upright have the
<pb n="878" facs="tcp:171178:446"/>habitual bent of their heart for God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>With my whole heart have I ſought thee.</hi> Their hearts ſtick to Gods teſtimonies, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Refraining the feet from every evil way, v.</hi> 101. Upright men are not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned by their good actions, as by this bent of heart. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.3.30.18, 19. It's called a not departing from Gods judgements, <hi>v.</hi> 102. a keeping of Gods precepts, <hi>v.</hi> 106. an inclining of the heart to perform Gods ſtatutes unto the end, <hi>v.</hi> 112. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.8. <hi>The deſire of my ſoul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</hi> That the bent of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearts is for God, appears in their readineſs, chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and delight they have in doing ſuch things as God requires. So <hi>Paul, Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> As we ſee a ſhip that hath winde and tide with it bends more and more to the haven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Cenſoriouſneſs of other mens actions, when thy ſelf lives in groſs ſins. When a man can ſee motes in another, I mean ſins of infirmities, to which the holieſt are liable, and cannot ſee beams in himſelf, <hi>ſtrain at a gnat</hi> in another, <hi>and ſwallow a Camel, Matth.</hi> 23.24. So the Ruler of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue <hi>Luke</hi> 13.13, 14. (whom Chriſt therefore called hypocrite) cenſured Chriſt for healing a daughter of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> on the Sabbath, when on that ſame day every one of them would lead their Aſs to watering. The way to make themſelves even with the beſt men, is either to grow higher, which their luſts will not ſuffer them, or to pull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lower, hence they cenſure the beſt men, and even <hi>motes</hi> in ſuch, ſins of ignorance and infirmity, yea many times that which is no ſin, as the Phariſees taxed Chriſts Diſciples for eating with unwaſhen hands, when mean time their own hearts were unwaſht, for plucking a few ears of corn, when their own houſes were full of rapine. Contrary, upright men are moſt cenſorious againſt themſelves, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. <hi>Theſe ſheep what have they done? let thy hand be againſt me and againſt my fathers houſe.</hi> His ſubjects doubtleſs had
<pb n="879" facs="tcp:171178:446"/>much provoked God, yet he had more to ſay againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf then againſt all his ſubjects. So <hi>Nehemiah, c.</hi> 1.6, 7. Would we judge our ſelves we ſhould have leſs time, and more compaſſion to judge others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Partiality in obedience. The hypocrite will onely do ſome or many things, not all, as <hi>Herod, Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.28. If thou ſuffer thy ſelf to be drawn to ſome good things not all, and withdrawn from ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils not all, and that for thy own credit, profit, or eaſe ſake, and not Gods ſake, onely or principally, thou art a plain hypocrite. Let there be one idol in our hearts of which thy heart upon deliberation will, or muſt ſay, thou wilt rather leave the Lord then it, thou art no better then an hypocrite. If we live but in one ſin (though every man that lives in one lives in more) we manifeſt a plain contempt of God, yea we ſet up a god to our ſelves. When <hi>David</hi> pronounces a bleſſing to an upright man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1. he tells us who is ſuch, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>They ſeek God with the whole heart,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>They do no iniquity.</hi> So long as a man picks and chuſes Gods commands, and obeys them with ſuch and ſuch reſervations, let ſuch a man know he is no better then an hypocrite. If there be any uprightneſs in thee thou wilt be ſtirr'd up at thy own lye, as well as at an other mans oath. Unſound men never cloſe with all duties, nor part with all ſins, but ſtill retain ſome darling ſin, which tends to their profit, or credit, or pleaſure, yea the duties they do are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome outward principle. Even as heat that is natural is durable, but adventitious heat is ſoon gone, as in water, meat boyled or roſted. So outward principles ſetting hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites awork, as ſhame of the world, fear of hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do many things, but the cauſe being taken away, the effect ceaſes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 A compliant turning of themſelves according to times and places. So <hi>Achitophel</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> Court would be very devout, but when there was a rebellion he would be firſt in
<pb n="880" facs="tcp:171178:447"/>it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.12, 13. Hypocrites when they are in good company and good families can frame themſelves thereto, and they can game, talk wantonly, ſpeak againſt goodneſs, when they are elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>A true Chriſtian findes it harder to be good in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and companies then in others, and the devil when he hath the opportunity of time, place and company, will preſs more hard upon a childe of God to do evil, alſo to put him back from goodneſs, when time, place, and company ſtand croſs to goodneſs; yea ſometimes temptations of fear or hope may ſhake a Chriſtian in his obedience, yet his deſires ſo hang to the Lord, that he is not at reſt till he have retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his firſt husband, and to his former obedience. Yea he hath not a complying principle of hypocriſie to ſute his practice to times and places. <hi>Joaſh</hi> was an unſound man, and, when he came in bad company, he came to be like like them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.17. but a ſincere ſoul reſolves to follow duty though all the world ſhould be againſt it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right men they apprehend the Lord every where preſent, hence they labour to walk before him. When its a thing God would have him do, he doth <hi>not conſult with fleſh and blood,</hi> whether he had beſt to do it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. but doth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſultment of fleſh and blood. Still an upright man is thinking, what will God have me do? If Gods word bid him do a thing, he doth it, though not without ſome han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging back of the fleſh, but unſound men ſtill think, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will this tend to their credit and profit? with theſe two are their ſouls carried like a Coach with the horſes, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to all times, places and companie.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 When a ſoul hath onely ſome good fits and moods of goodneſs. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Thy righteouſneſs is like the morning dew,</hi> which hath a fit of coming, and then goes away. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> had ſuch a fit, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10. <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous.</hi> So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſent for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in haſte to pray for him. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.16. So thoſe hypocrites, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                     <pb n="881" facs="tcp:171178:447"/>78.34, 35. <hi>When he ſlew them then they ſought him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired early after God, nevertheleſs they did but flatter with their mouth.</hi> Such were <hi>Jonah's</hi> mariners, as ſome think, <hi>Jon.</hi> 1.5. and <hi>John's</hi> hearers, who rejoyced in <hi>John's</hi> doctrine for a ſeaſon. So <hi>Saul,</hi> in a fit he cries out, <hi>Thou art more righteous then I, my ſon David.</hi> Some when the Lord afflicts them with the death of relations and other croſſes, have a fit of godly ſorrow, as that Scribe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.20.</p>
                  <p>That this may not be miſtaken take four cautions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That a man may have intermiſſions, wherein his grace, zeal, and heavenly mindedneſs may not appear in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that ſometimes it hath appeared, and yet be ſincere, as <hi>Aſa,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 A ſoul may have declenſions and decaies in grace, and yet not ſerve God by fits, as in the Angel of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and to keep the ſoul in that height of conſiſtence, whereto perhaps at preſent it is wrought, is not poſſible, becauſe the lifting up of the ſoul depends upon the ſpirits breathing, who is a free agent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 A Saint may be more godly at ſome time then at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet not ſerve God by fits; as the Husbandman labours all the year, but ſpecially in ſeed-time and harveſt. A believer may conſtantly follow the Lord, yet ſometimes be more in heaven, taken up with <hi>Moſes</hi> into the Mount.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The deeplier a ſoul is in diſtreſs, the more earneſtly ſhould he ſeek God, and yet this is no ſerving God by fits. So <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Whales belly, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.7. and thoſe <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.17. and it's ſaid of hypocrites, They cry not when God bindes them, <hi>Job</hi> 36.13.</p>
                  <p>But this I call a ſerving God by fits and moods, when all a mans religion is onely for a fit. So long as ſuch a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate favours it, and when he falls off they fall off; as when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> forſook the Lord, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> forſook the Law of the Lord with him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1. So to have a fit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſo long as Gods hand is upon us, after, when his
<pb n="882" facs="tcp:171178:448"/>hand is taken away, to be as bad as we were, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 35, 36.</p>
                  <p>As there's difference betwixt a well ſet colour in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons face, and a colour that ariſes from bluſhing, ſo there's difference betwixt fits and ſtates of godlineſs. Hypocrites have fits but not ſtates. Suddain heats and ſuddain colds argue an unhealthfull temperature in the body, ſo doth it in the Spirit: ſome are mightily lifted up at a Sermon, by and by, as preſently cold. <hi>Jehu</hi> hot againſt <hi>Baal,</hi> cold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Calves. By the equality of pulſe we judge of the body, let us do ſo of the ſoul, not by what it is in a fit. A man may have a fit of crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and next day cry, Crucifie. Our obedience ſhould be like the fire of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary that never went out.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 When a man willingly winks againſt light, and will not ſee that which is either contrary to his luſts, or may expoſe him to ſufferings, loath to read ſuch Books, hear ſuch Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, or meditate of ſuch Scriptures, as may inform him of ſuch ſins as he is loath to part with, or to do ſuch duties as he is unwilling to do. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>They with-hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Joh. 3.21. Theſe are ſaid, <hi>not to come to the light, leſt their deeds ſhould be diſcovered.</hi> Matth. 13.15. <hi>They have cloſed up their eys.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. They are willingly ignorant. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.10. <hi>They ſay to the ſeers, See not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Contrarily ſincere men have their hearts open to know the whole minde of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 A care to reform the outward man with a neglect of the inward man. Hypocrites are buſieſt in outward performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For example, in matters of religion, there's the outward part and the inward part, for the outward part, as hearing, preſenting himſelf at worſhip, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.10. <hi>He comes and goes to the place of the holy,</hi> but for the inward part, to wit, the bleeding heart, the melting affection, the rectified will, the
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:171178:448"/>inward waſhing of the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. theſe he is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from. He is like a Bankrupt that makes ſhow of all and more then all the wares he hath. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.7, 8, 9. <hi>Ye Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, well did Iſaiah ſay, this people draweth nigh me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Contrary the ſincere Chriſtian is like a rich Merchant that hath much more goods then is ſeen, in Ware-houſes and Cellars: if he cleanſe himſelf he labours not onely to cleanſe his hands, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did, but he cleanſes his heart. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. If he gives thanks he doth not onely lift up his hand but his heart to God in the heavens, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. He cleanſes himſelf not onely <hi>from filthineſs of the fleſh, but of the Spirit.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. If he give alms he draws out his ſoul to the hungry, as well as his hand. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.10. If he obey God in any command it's from the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23. If he be baptized, he cares not onely to have his body waſhed with pure water, but to have his heart ſprinkled from an evil conſcience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. He doth not onely ſpeak of good things with his tongue, but the Law of God is in his heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.31. Becauſe the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part is eaſie and glorious in the eys of the world, the hypocrite will do that, but the inward part being difficult and coſtly he will not do that.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 A following God in cheap and creditable duties, but not in coſtly and diſhonourable duties. So <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.8, 9. <hi>Saul</hi> deſtroyed the worſt of the ſheep and cattel, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that was vile and refuſe they deſtroyed utterly, but for <hi>Agag</hi> and the beſt of the ſheep, and oxen, and fatlings, and all that was good, they would not utterly deſtroy. So when a duty is creditable a hypocrite will do it, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Religion forwardly where it is in credit, as many hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites did in <hi>Joſiah's</hi> time, whoſe hypocriſie was ſeen when he was dead.</p>
                  <p>Contrarily ſincere perſons follow God in coſtly duties: if duty coſt them all their preferment and wealth, they will
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:171178:449"/>part with it, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.26. <hi>They will not offer to God that which coſts them nothing:</hi> ſo in duties where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is no credit, as <hi>David</hi> when he danced before the ark of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20. though <hi>Michal</hi> ſcoft at him, yet would he do it.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Self juſtification and tranſlation of the fault upon others. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.13. <hi>I have performed the commandment of the Lord,</hi> but <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, <hi>What means the bleating of the ſheep, and the lowing of the Oxen which I hear? Saul</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>The people ſpared of the beſt of the ſheep, and of the Oxen.</hi> He laies the fault on the people, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Contrarily, ſincere ſouls take the ſhame of their evils don to themſelves, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18. When this frame of ſelf juſtification is uſual, its a bad temper. See it in the <hi>Phariſee, Luke</hi> 18.12, 13. Contrary the publican. But this ſign I apply to an act, rather then to a ſtate of hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 The living in ſin, mean while pretending to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: ſee it in that ſtrumpet; <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.14. ſhe ſeemed very devout, yet was an arrant ſtrumpet, ſee <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.10, 11. <hi>Herod, Mark</hi> 6.20. In the midſt of all his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he lived, in inceſt, by this was <hi>Jehu, Saul, &amp;c.</hi> diſcovered, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.13, 14. One ſin lived in proves a man an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>John</hi> 5.44. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.13.</p>

                  <head>Remedies againſt hypocriſie.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 Beg a ſound heart of God, that he would give thee a right Spirit, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.10.143.10. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.24. <hi>Try me, O Lord, ſearch me, ſee if there be any way of wickedneſs in me.</hi> Though Satan may tell thee God hears thee not, becauſe thou art an hypocrite, yet mayeſt thou anſwer him, <hi>He that confeſſes and forſakes ſhall finde mercy, Prov.</hi> 28.13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Walk ſutable to thy own principles: beware what principles thou receiveſt, but having received them, and thy conſcience having given judgement herein, walk ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them. It's greatly hypocritical to have our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="885" facs="tcp:171178:449"/>go one way and our practice another; yet ought there to be a tender reſpect to the principles of others, judging that with as good a conſcience they refrain that which you conſcientiouſly ſeem to practiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Search thy heart to finde out thy hypocriſy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail it. So Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> was wont to call himſelf a painted hypocrite. If we finde ſincerity wrought in us, let us hold faſt the comfort of it, <hi>Job.</hi> 27.5. But if on the other ſide we finde we prefer our credit and profit before the Lord, that we retain ſome darling ſin, and that we will not do ſome coſtly, painfull, or ſhamefull duty, <hi>that we make clean the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the cup and platter, but the inſide is full of filth,</hi> that we uſually do that in ſecret we would not for a world ſhould come abroad, ſee that thou bewail all theſe hypocriſies, thou being weary and heavy loaden with this ſin as well as others, art bid to come to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28.</p>
                  <p>Say not thou if thou have been an hypocrite all this while it will never be better, if thou wilt not ſee the hypocriſie of thy heart, and confeſs and bewail it before the Lord thou ſhalt never be better, but if believingly thou mourn under it, there is <hi>a fountain ſet open,</hi> to waſh thee from this as well as from other <hi>pollutions, Zac.</hi> 13.1. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 8. And for the reliques of hypocriſie by often ſearching and bewailing they are weeded out; every time a garden is weeded the weeds are the fewer, and the herbs and flowers proſper better.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Trace your hearts in your motives, actings and ends. Its hard for creatures to get lurking holes when they are cloſely hunted; ſo hunt thy hypocriſie and it will hardly get harbour, reflect upon thy ſelf and conſider the motives that ſet thee on work to do ſuch an action: was it the glory of God, or thy own glory, when thou denies thy ſelf in ſuch an enjoyment? was it out of love to God, or to get eſteem? <hi>Hezekiah</hi> thus traced his heart, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38.3. and ſo did <hi>David</hi> in the matter of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> hence he ſo prayes <hi>that

Trace thy heart in thy dealings of buying, ſelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with men, and thou ſhalt finde much hypocriſie, in thy pretences of love to thy friends, in thy ſpeaking of thine enemies. How often doſt thou in thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions ſeem, if not what thou art, yet more then thou art? how oft doſt thou among bad men ſeem worſe then thou art? and among good men ſeem better then thou art? If thou thus traceſt thy heart, hypocriſie will not have a quiet abode in thy heart.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Look upon Gods all-ſeeing eye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He ponders all our goings,</hi> as well of the inward man, as outward man, <hi>he knows every one of them. Ezek.</hi> 11.5. Yea every thought, <hi>Job.</hi> 42.2. If a man lookt upon us we would not dally with him, nor diſſemble with him, why doſt thou deal hypocritically? ſurely becauſe thou more or leſs queſtions or forgets Gods omniſcience. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 44.17, 18, compared with <hi>v.</hi> 21.</p>

Thou haſt a watchfull eye upon thieviſh ſlippery ſervants, have the ſame of thy theeviſh ſlippery heart. If we be not jealous

                  <p n="9">9 Repent of every known ſin: if there be one ſin in thee unrepented of, thou art an hypocrite. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein? q. d.</hi> How is it poſſible?

How carefull
<pb n="890" facs="tcp:171178:452"/>are we not to be cheated of our eſtates on earth? much more take care thou be not cheated of the crown in heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Exhort.</hi> Be laborious in the work of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Be ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as you know your labour will not be in vain in the Lord.

                  <p>Laſtly, in that the Diſciples propound the ſcruples, and Chriſt anſwers them, both in <hi>v.</hi> 34. and in theſe three laſt verſes, obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> The Saints of God ſhould endeavour ſatisfaction in their ſcruples.</p>
                  <pb n="891" facs="tcp:171178:452"/>
                  <p>Two things. 1 What a ſcruple is, 2 Why Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould labour and endeavour for ſatisfaction herein.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What a ſcruple is. The Latin word <hi>ſcrupulus</hi> is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of <hi>ſcrupus,</hi> which ſignifies a little <hi>ſharp ſtone,</hi> which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a mans ſhoes troubles him in travel, metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally it ſignifies a doubt or trouble which inwardly grates upon the ſoul, putting it to pain for want of light until the conſcience have ſatisfaction therein, though therein the conſcience incline to one ſide.</p>
                  <p>In which five things;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 A ſcruple is a doubt or trouble wherein the ſoul is troubled as to the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of a thing, as to the practiſing or forbearing of a thing. When a man <hi>asks queſtion for conſcience ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The ſeat of this ſcrupling or doubting, it's in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Whatſoever is ſold in the ſhambles that eat, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake:</hi> ſo that when a thing is to be done or forborn you ask a queſtion herein to ſatisfie conſcience, which cannot witneſs with you concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the rectitude of ſuch an action, but ſtands heſitating and doubting herein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 This doubt or ſcruple inwardly grates upon the ſoul, and puts it to pain, ſo that the ſoul is heavy and lumpiſh under it, and ſometimes grieved, and ſometimes preſſes the ſoul down with the weight thereof, that the removing of it is as if you ſhould take off a talent of lead.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The cauſe of all ſcruples is want of light, becauſe a ſoul cannot ſee his way: hence ſome ſcrupulous ſouls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.2. wanting light to ſee that they might feed on all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures lawfully, <hi>fed onely upon hearbs,</hi> for fear they ſhould eat ſome meat which God in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law had forbidden.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 There is an inclination to the lawfulneſs of one part above another, but yet not without trouble becauſe of ſome difficulties it knowes not how to anſwer. For example, when a Chriſtian was invited to go to a feaſt that was at an
<pb n="892" facs="tcp:171178:453"/>Idolaters houſe, but was no Idol feaſt, there could not but be ſome trouble in the hearts of ſome, whether they ſhould go, yet the conſcience inclined to dictate that they might go from that permiſſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27. When a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, 4. wrought a miracle that came to paſs, and ſollicited them to go after other gods, they could not but have ſome doubt in their mindes, whether they ſhould go after ſtrange gods, yet, conſcience inclining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to truth, they were to ſtand to that, and to abandon the ſcruple, and to ſuppreſs and conclude againſt the reaſons and arguments which cauſed them to doubt: ſo that the difference betwixt a doubtfull and a ſcrupulous conſcience is this, A doubtfull conſcience hangs in ſuſpence with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of reaſons, concerning the lawfulneſs and unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſomething to be practiſed or believed, but a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conſcience inclines to the lawfulneſs of the thing to be done, but not without ſome doubts, becauſe of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the arguments, which it well knowes not how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. When we incline to the lawfulneſs of a thing we ſhould labour to ſuppreſs all difficulties, which cauſe us to doubt, if that cannot be done, yet are we to go to that ſide conſcience moſt inclines to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But do not all doubts in the conſcience ſuſpend a mans acting every way, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he eat? Rom.</hi> 14.23. and, <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> and, <hi>Every man is to be fully perſwaded in his own minde, v.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> All doubts in the conſcience do not ſuſpend a mans acting in practiſe. For example, a man doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt day of the week be a day appointed by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God for worſhip, his conſcience perhaps doubts both ways, yet, may he keep it, for where there is no harm in the practical part the doubt may without harm be in the conſcience, and yet he may act one way. But thoſe doubts ſeem to me to ſuſpend practiſe where arguments are of
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:171178:453"/>equal force both ways, as where there are two faces of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in a nation, the conſcience queſtions which have right on their ſide, the ſubject ſo doubting muſt be neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When conſcience doubts on one part, and is reſolved on the other, we muſt refuſe the doubting part, and take that wherein we are ſure; as in Cards and Dice, if we play not we are ſafe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When conſcience doubts on both ſides, which is the ſin and which not, then ought a man to do that which is moſt void of offence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 We may have ſundry doubts of other mens actings, and yet theſe not hinder our own acting; nor do they come under <hi>Paul</hi>'s kinde of doubting, who ſpeaks onely of a mans own actings; our conſcience or perſwaſion hath nothing to do to judge an other mans liberty, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.29. For example, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> laid a tax upon all the world, ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians doubted that part of this tax would be beſtowed on Idols and their Prieſts, and therefore doubted whether they might pay <hi>Auguſtus</hi> tribute: their doubts were not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, they might pay tribute notwithſtanding theſe doubts, for they had nothing to do to doubt or judge what <hi>Auguſtus</hi> would do with it, being ſecret in his own breaſt. An Officer doubts the Magiſtrate hath given an unjuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, yet may he execute it, becauſe his own duty is clear to him, but the Magiſtrates injuſtice is not. I am a Church member, I doubt my fellow member is an hypocrite, yet may I communicate with him, becauſe his hypocriſie doth not appear, and the manifeſtation of his evil and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church thereupon, is the ground for my not communicating, not my doubting of his unſoundneſs. A ſouldier doubts his Captain ſends him upon an unjuſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, this ſouldier if he know not the injuſtice may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In your own proper actings do not that you doubt of.
<pb n="894" facs="tcp:171178:454"/>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5, 23. As it's againſt the Law of friendſhip wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to do that which we doubt, whether it will be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to our friend, ſo is it againſt the Law of the love of God to do ſuch things as we doubt whether or no do pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1 Becauſe ſatisfaction in ſcruples tends much to the quieting of the ſoul. The Jews doubted whether any of their members might eat with the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.2. and ſome of them dealt with <hi>Peter</hi> herein. When <hi>Peter</hi> gave them ſatisfaction concerning the lawfulneſs thereof, <hi>They were glad and glorified God, v.</hi> 18. Then is it that a man can act comfortably and chearfully.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Clearing up of ſcruples tends to make Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion comfortable. The Jews did earneſtly endeavour to keep the ceremonial commands of the Law, and to impoſe them upon others, and would not have communion with the Gentile brethren that would not keep them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1. On the other ſide the Gentile believers, knowing their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by Chriſt, would exclude the Jews (living Jewiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) from their communion, whereupon a Schiſm was like to ariſe; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> to heal the ſcruples on all ſides warns the Jewiſh believers ſo to follow their opinion, that they did not condemn the Gentile believers of wickedneſs, and warns the Gentile believers that they ſhould not refrain the Communion of the Jewiſh believers, becauſe they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Jewiſhly, nor deſpiſe them for it, but that they ſhould receive one another to Church-fellowſhip. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtfull diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> The words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifie the judging of thoughts, <hi>q.d.</hi> Do not you Gentile believers judge whether they uſe theſe ceremonial commands as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or as profitable, or how they hold them in their conſcience, what have you to do to rifle there? what have you to do to judge their thoughts?</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The great anguiſh that is in the ſoul for want of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:171178:454"/>herein Many have ſcruples as to vows, oaths, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, aſſurance, obedience to mens commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and go on in a pining condition for many years together, when one word of a faithfull Teacher, or Brother would quiet all. How much better did thoſe poor Jews who were pricked in their hearts for guilt? Who in their anguiſh of conſcience asked of <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles, <hi>Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ſhall we do? Peter</hi> with a few words ſpeaking, heals all the ſcruple, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38, 39. ſaying, <hi>Repent and be baptized,</hi> but they had another ſcruple, that in their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt Chriſt, they had wiſhed <hi>his blood be on their children,</hi> this ſcruple <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers, <hi>The promiſe is to you and to your children when the Lord ſhall call them.</hi> For to ſatisfie afflicted ſouls, the Lord hath given the tongue of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.4. How painfull have the doubts and ſcruples about aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance been to ſundry of Gods children? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7, 8, 9. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.14, 15. Eſpecially when an evil day comes, as ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How will theſe ſcruples afflict you? how will they make you unwilling to dye? It's like <hi>David</hi> had a ſcruple on his death bed for not putting <hi>Joab</hi> to death who had kild two innocent men, hence he gives <hi>Solomon</hi> order to put him to death; for we cannot think that now when he expected mercy from God he did it out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Exhort to clear up all thy ſcruples; Now ſcruples are of two ſorts;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Rational and material, ſo the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſcruple where the place of worſhip, and where the true Church was, whether in Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> where was a Temple built by <hi>Manaſſes</hi> the High Prieſts ſon (as <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> mentions) or whether at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the place of worſhip? Chriſt anſwers her ſcruple, 1 Condemns her worſhip and the worſhip of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> becauſe not grounded upon knowledge, ſaying, <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not
<pb n="896" facs="tcp:171178:455"/>what, Joh.</hi> 4.22. 2 Commends the worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by two reaſons. <hi>v.</hi> 22. 1 Becauſe grounded upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>We know what we worſhip.</hi> 2 Becauſe the Jews had the means of ſalvation there, which the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had not, ſaying, <hi>Salvation is of the Jews.</hi> Such was that of <hi>Joſeph, Matth.</hi> 1.19, 20. who was perplexed about the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Irrational and circumſtantial. Satan puſsles many with theſe, as ſome perſons when they have paid money, becauſe they could not remember the time or place, have ſcrupled whether they have paid it, though their hearts tell them they pay every man preſently after it is due. Sometimes when a ſoul hath cleared up a ſcruple to full ſatisfaction, the devil comes a year or more after and endeavours to trouble him again, to re-act a diſcuſſion of the ſame queſtion, in both which caſes Satan endeavours to rob us of our time, carrying us to impertinencies, and if poſſible to make us walk heavily. I much queſtion whether it were not a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſcruple in <hi>David,</hi> when his heart ſmote him for cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.4, 5. ſeeing he did it not for to affright him, nor to impoveriſh him, but to make his own innocency appear, that he was not an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to him. Others ſcruple whether it be lawfull to eat fleſh upon a Friday, whether they may teach their children a Catechiſm or patern of ſound words, the ſlighting of theſe and ſuch like is not a way to weaken but to ſtrengthen the conſcience. All ſcruples that bring not a word are frivolous and vain, and not to be diſcuſſed.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 Suffer not men to impoſe upon us and ſubject us to their ordinances, beyond the bounds of the word. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18, 20, 21. The falſe Teachers would have impoſed Angel-worſhip, and would <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2 Where we come where perſons can reſolve us, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound our doubts, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. As of old <hi>Prieſts lips did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve knowledge,</hi> ſo ſhould the lips of Church Elders. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lay aſide ſinfull baſhfulneſs which makes many go ſadly for want of propounding the difficulties which afflict them: thus did the Churches of <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 15.2. and <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25, 27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Urge the Lord with his promiſe to give you direction in your difficulties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12. <hi>What man is he that fears the Lord? Him ſhall he direct in the way that he ſhall chuſe.</hi> Prov. 3.6. <hi>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thy ſteps. David</hi> was in a ſtrait to know whether <hi>Saul</hi> would come againſt <hi>Keilah,</hi> and whether the men of <hi>Kei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> would deliver him up, and he enquires of God herein, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.11, 12. and the Lord anſwered him, <hi>that the men of Keilah would deliver him up,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 7.6. to <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.26, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Examine reaſons on all ſides, and then go that way which ſeems likelieſt, and hath beſt reaſons out of Gods word. <hi>David</hi> had a great ſcruple about Gods providence as to wicked men, untill <hi>he went into the Sanctuary of God,</hi> and there in the Miniſtry of Gods word he found reaſons to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh him, to wit concerning their end. 1 That though they were ſo happy at preſent, yet they ſtood in ſlippery places. 2 That they were caſt down into deſtruction and deſolation in a moment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>But if reaſons from Gods word are equal on both ſides, chuſe that ſide that hath leaſt fleſhly reſpects in it, I mean as to thy ſelf, as to ſelf-credit, profit or benefit, or makes moſt for Religion, Gods glory, and the credit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, according to thoſe three rules, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.31, 32, 33.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Finde out the cauſe of your ſcruple. If it be ignorance, ſtrive for information, and do not out of conceitedneſs of thy own opinion put it off.</p>
                  <pb n="898" facs="tcp:171178:456"/>
                  <p>If Satans ſuggeſtion, compare the reaſons with the Word. If melancholy be the cauſe, as often it is, compare the ſoul when it is in a quiet frame, and the melancholy fit over with thoſe reaſons that appeared in the time of melancholy, thou ſhalt ſee a great unlikeneſs betwixt them, as betwixt water when it is puddled or jumbled together, and water when it is cleer.</p>
                  <p>If thy ſcruple ariſe from ſcrupulous perſons, conſider the weight of their reaſons, remembring no man is to be heeded more then his reaſon weighs.</p>
                  <p>If it ariſe from fear of ſinning againſt God and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of duty, then remember its backt with a plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Beware you do not ſtrain at a Gnat and ſwallow a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel; to ſcruple about the payment of <hi>the tithe of rue, mint, aniſe, and cummin, and neglect the weightier matters of the Law, juſtice and the love of God:</hi> we may ſcruple juſtly to break the leaſt command, as <hi>Daniel</hi> was reſolvedly ſet not to defile himſelf with the portion of the Kings meat, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.8. as alſo not to neglect a duty, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. yet be ſure that you be as much or more ſcrupulous in the weightier matters of the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. by no means to have the leaſt hand in the violation of them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Let not the minde run too much upon a ſcruple, for Satan is wont to ſtir up a great fog and miſt in the minds of ſome conſcientious people, and ſo to impreſs ſtrange things on the imagination, by the mindes ſtill running thereupon, though ſome are too far the other way that they will not ſo much as reaſon whether things be right or wrong.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 When we ſee ſcruples are needleſs and endleſs and cannot be taken away with contrary reaſon, let them forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be laid aſide at leaſt till another time, for ſometimes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan followes weak Chriſtians ſo cloſely, that they can no other way get out of them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Where we ſee the queſtions we have in our mindes are
<pb n="899" facs="tcp:171178:456"/>needleſs ſcruples, wherein is no reaſon, we may act againſt them, and yet the conſcience not be weaker but ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 In caſe of ſcrupling let conſcience ſpeak out till it it have no more to ſay, and beware you do not put a trick upon conſcience by a cunning diſtinction. If conſcience put thee upon hard things yet be ſure to follow it, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22, 23, 24. as it may be it puts thee upon duty whereby thou ſhalt loſe ſome dear friend, and procure ſome heavy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Beware of pretending a ſcruple when there is no ſuch thing. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.16, 17. The <hi>Herodians</hi> come to Chriſt and pretend a ſcruple, <hi>We know thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth, neither careſt thou for any man, for thou regardeſt not the perſon of men, tell us, Is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to give tribute to Caeſar, or not?</hi> In which queſtion they onely endeavoured enſnarement, if Chriſt ſaid it was lawfull, they would have rendered him a flattering time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, becauſe the Jews held generally that the Romans had violently ſubdued them; if he had ſaid it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they would have accuſed him of treaſon againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Thus to pretend a ſcruple is an act of groſs hypocriſie, and thoſe that thus ſet up a ſtumbling block of iniquity, and come to a Prophet to enquire concerning the Lord or his ways, the Lord will anſwer him accordingly, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.7. <hi>And I will ſet my face againſt that man.</hi> So thoſe, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 42.5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Do not deſpiſe nor be eager againſt ſcrupulous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>Scrupuloſi non ſunt rigidè tractandi,</hi> ſaid <hi>Antoninus</hi> the <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> becauſe this tenderneſs of conſcience when it is real is a pretious principle, ariſing from a great meaſure of Gods fear, and is a fruit of the ſpirit in whom it is, though ſometimes through ignorance and injudiciouſneſs it ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples where it ought not. Yet as in fields where there are many briars, thiſtles, and thorns, it argues there is good
<pb n="900" facs="tcp:171178:457"/>ground if it were well husbanded, ſo a heart that conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly ſcruples, though often the ſcruples are not good, yet they, ariſing from a true fear of not ſinning againſt God, they argue the heart is good. Yet an enlightned. conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, other things being like, is better then a ſcrupuling conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 Sometimes a ſcruple may be determined by an uſe of lot, when a ſoul doubts which way God would have him to go, yet he is ſo purged from ſelf-endedneſs that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires God may determine the matter. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.24. <hi>Thou, Lord, which knoweſt the hearts, ſhow which of theſe two thou haſt choſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14 To ſcruple in ſmall things and not in great matters is a note of a hypocrite. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. Alſo the Jewiſh Prieſts ſcrupled the bringing the thirty pieces into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, being the <hi>price of blood, Matth.</hi> 27.6. yet they ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled not to ſhed innocent blood. The Jews ſcrupled to give <hi>Paul</hi> one ſtripe above the Law; the Law was, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.3. that the Judge determine him forty ſtripes but not exceed, now the Jews whipt <hi>Paul</hi> five times, and they ſcrupled ſo to tranſgreſs the Law herein, that they gave him but thirty nine ſtripes, but they ſcrupled not to whip an innocent perſon. <hi>Saul</hi> would not eat with the blood, he ſcrupled it, yet would he not ſcruple to take away the lives of fourſcore of the Lords Prieſts at one time.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 Still urge thy ſoul to give a reaſon of thy ſcruple. So <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 43.5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? and why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> If the ſoul cannot render a reaſon of it, be ſure it comes either from Satan or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, or ſome ſuch cauſe, or its ſome injected tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as the devil caſt into Chriſts minde, to make him ſcruple whether God was his father.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 Anſwer the ſcruples. When thou ſeeſt them mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt fallacies in grace, though true conſequences in nature: for example, Satan ſaith thou art a ſinner, God is juſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:171178:457"/>he hates thee, therefore inflicts puniſhment, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hears thee not, this conſequence cannot be denied in nature. The conſequence of grace is, thou art a ſinner therefore believe, and when Satan oppoſes thy ſins, ſay, What is that to thee Satan? I have not ſinn'd againſt thee but againſt my God, I am not thy ſinner, what power haſt thou over me, Satan, if it be truly a ſin whereof thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeſt me? Satan ſometimes terrifies the minde alſo with thoſe things which are not ſins but he alledges them to be ſins, as Chriſt will not <hi>quench ſmoaking flax,</hi> no more will I quench it in my ſelf.</p>
